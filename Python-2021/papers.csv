"High-performance medicine: the convergence of human and artificial intelligence","The use of artificial intelligence, and the deep-learning subtype in particular, has been enabled by the use of labeled big data, along with markedly enhanced computing power and cloud storage, across all sectors. In medicine, this is beginning to have an impact at three levels: for clinicians, predominantly via rapid, accurate image interpretation; for health systems, by improving workflow and the potential for reducing medical errors; and for patients, by enabling them to process their own data to promote health. The current limitations, including bias, privacy and security, and lack of transparency, along with the future directions of these applications will be discussed in this article. Over time, marked improvements in accuracy, productivity, and workflow will likely be actualized, but whether that will be used to improve the patient-doctor relationship or facilitate its erosion remains to be seen.","Topol, EJ",2019,"NATURE MEDICINE"

"Probabilistic machine learning and artificial intelligence","How can a machine learn from experience? Probabilistic modelling provides a framework for understanding what learning is, and has therefore emerged as one of the principal theoretical and practical approaches for designing machines that learn from data acquired through experience. The probabilistic framework, which describes how to represent and manipulate uncertainty about models and predictions, has a central role in scientific data analysis, machine learning, robotics, cognitive science and artificial intelligence. This Review provides an introduction to this framework, and discusses some of the state-of-the-art advances in the field, namely, probabilistic programming, Bayesian optimization, data compression and automatic model discovery.","Ghahramani, Z",2015,"NATURE"
"A comparison of performance of several artificial intelligence methods for forecasting monthly discharge time series","Developing a hydrological forecasting model based on past records is crucial to effective hydropower reservoir management and scheduling. Traditionally, time series analysis and modeling is used for building mathematical models to generate hydrologic records in hydrology and water resources. Artificial intelligence (AI), as a branch of computer science, is capable of analyzing long-series and large-scale hydrological data. In recent years, it is one of front issues to apply AI technology to the hydrological forecasting modeling. In this paper, autoregressive moving-average (ARMA) models, artificial neural networks (ANNs) approaches, adaptive neural-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) techniques, genetic programming (GP) models and support vector machine (SVM) method are examined using the long-term observations of monthly river flow discharges. The four quantitative standard statistical performance evaluation measures, the coefficient of correlation (R), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (E), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), are employed to evaluate the performances of various models developed. Two case study river sites are also provided to illustrate their respective performances. The results indicate that the best performance can be obtained by ANFIS, GP and SVM, in terms of different evaluation criteria during the training and validation phases. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

"Artificial intelligence in radiology","Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, particularly deep learning, have demonstrated remarkable progress in image-recognition tasks. Methods ranging from convolutional neural networks to variational autoencoders have found myriad applications in the medical image analysis field, propelling it forward at a rapid pace. Historically, in radiology practice, trained physicians visually assessed medical images for the detection, characterization and monitoring of diseases. AI methods excel at automatically recognizing complex patterns in imaging data and providing quantitative, rather than qualitative, assessments of radiographic characteristics. In this Opinion article, we establish a general understanding of AI methods, particularly those pertaining to image-based tasks. We explore how these methods could impact multiple facets of radiology, with a general focus on applications in oncology, and demonstrate ways in which these methods are advancing the field. Finally, we discuss the challenges facing clinical implementation and provide our perspective on how the domain could be advanced.","Hosny, A; Parmar, C; Quackenbush, J; Schwartz, LH; Aerts, HJWL",2018,"NATURE REVIEWS CANCER"

"Brain Intelligence: Go beyond Artificial Intelligence","Artificial intelligence (AI) is an important technology that supports daily social life and economic activities. It contributes greatly to the sustainable growth of Japan's economy and solves various social problems. In recent years, AI has attracted attention as a key for growth in developed countries such as Europe and the United States and developing countries such as China and India. The attention has been focused mainly on developing new artificial intelligence information communication technology (ICT) and robot technology (RT). Although recently developed AI technology certainly excels in extracting certain patterns, there are many limitations. Most ICT models are overly dependent on big data, lack a self-idea function, and are complicated. In this paper, rather than merely developing next-generation artificial intelligence technology, we aim to develop a new concept of general-purpose intelligence cognition technology called ""Beyond AI"". Specifically, we plan to develop an intelligent learning model called ""Brain Intelligence (BI)"" that generates new ideas about events without having experienced them by using artificial life with an imagine function. We will also conduct demonstrations of the developed BI intelligence learning model on automatic driving, precision medical care, and industrial robots.","Lu, HM; Li, YJ; Chen, M; Kim, H; Serikawa, S",2018,"MOBILE NETWORKS & APPLICATIONS"
"Peeking Inside the Black-Box: A Survey on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)","At the dawn of the fourth industrial revolution, we are witnessing a fast and widespread adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in our daily life, which contributes to accelerating the shift towards a more algorithmic society. However, even with such unprecedented advancements, a key impediment to the use of AI-based systems is that they often lack transparency. Indeed, the black-box nature of these systems allows powerful predictions, but it cannot be directly explained. This issue has triggered a new debate on explainable AI (XAI). A research field holds substantial promise for improving trust and transparency of AI-based systems. It is recognized as the sine qua non for AI to continue making steady progress without disruption.

"Applications of hybrid wavelet-Artificial Intelligence models in hydrology: A review","Accurate and reliable water resources planning and management to ensure sustainable use of watershed resources cannot be achieved without precise and reliable models. Notwithstanding the highly stochastic nature of hydrological processes, the development of models capable of describing such complex phenomena is a growing area of research. Providing insight into the modeling of complex phenomena through a thorough overview of the literature, current research, and expanding research horizons can enhance the potential for accurate and well designed models. The last couple of decades have seen remarkable progress in the ability to develop accurate hydrologic models. Among various conceptual and black box models developed over this period, hybrid wavelet and Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based models have been amongst the most promising in simulating hydrologic processes. The present review focuses on defining hybrid modeling, the advantages of such combined models, as well as the history and potential future of their application in hydrology to predict important processes of the hydrologic cycle. Over the years, the use of wavelet-AI models in hydrology has steadily increased and attracted interest given the robustness and accuracy of the approach. This is attributable to the usefulness of wavelet transforms in multi-resolution analysis, de-noising, and edge effect detection over a signal, as well as the strong capability of AI methods in optimization and prediction of processes.

"Using Artificial Intelligence to Detect COVID-19 and Community-acquired Pneumonia Based on Pulmonary CT: Evaluation of the Diagnostic Accuracy","Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has widely spread all over the world since the beginning of 2020. It is desirable to develop automatic and accurate detection of COVID-19 using chest CT. Purpose: To develop a fully automatic framework to detect COVID-19 using chest CT and evaluate its performance. Materials and Methods: In this retrospective and multicenter study, a deep learning model, the COVID-19 detection neural network (COVNet), was developed to extract visual features from volumetric chest CT scans for the detection of COVID-19. CT scans of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and other non-pneumonia abnormalities were included to test the robustness of the model. The datasets were collected from six hospitals between August 2016 and February 2020. Diagnostic performance was assessed with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, sensitivity, and specificity. Results: The collected dataset consisted of 4352 chest CT scans from 3322 patients. The average patient age (+/- standard deviation) was 49 years +/- 15, and there were slightly more men than women (1838 vs 1484, respectively; P =.29). The per-scan sensitivity and specificity for detecting COVID-19 in the independent test set was 90% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 83%, 94%; 114 of 127 scans) and 96% (95% CI: 93%, 98%; 294 of 307 scans), respectively, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.96 (P<.001). The per-scan sensitivity and specificity for detecting CAP in the independent test set was 87% (152 of 175 scans) and 92% (239 of 259 scans), respectively, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.95 (95% CI: 0.93, 0.97). Conclusion: A deep learning model can accurately detect coronavirus 2019 and differentiate it from community-acquired pneumonia and other lung conditions.

"Artificial Intelligence in Service","Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly reshaping service by performing various tasks, constituting a major source of innovation, yet threatening human jobs. We develop a theory of AI job replacement to address this double-edged impact. The theory specifies four intelligences required for service tasks-mechanical, analytical, intuitive, and empathetic-and lays out the way firms should decide between humans and machines for accomplishing those tasks. AI is developing in a predictable order, with mechanical mostly preceding analytical, analytical mostly preceding intuitive, and intuitive mostly preceding empathetic intelligence. The theory asserts that AI job replacement occurs fundamentally at the task level, rather than the job level, and for ""lower"" (easier for AI) intelligence tasks first. AI first replaces some of a service job's tasks, a transition stage seen as augmentation, and then progresses to replace human labor entirely when it has the ability to take over all of a job's tasks. The progression of AI task replacement from lower to higher intelligences results in predictable shifts over time in the relative importance of the intelligences for service employees. An important implication from our theory is that analytical skills will become less important, as AI takes over more analytical tasks, giving the ""softer"" intuitive and empathetic skills even more importance for service employees. Eventually, AI will be capable of performing even the intuitive and empathetic tasks, which enables innovative ways of human-machine integration for providing service but also results in a fundamental threat for human employment.","Huang, MH; Rust, RT",2018,"JOURNAL OF SERVICE RESEARCH"

"Explanation in artificial intelligence: Insights from the social sciences","There has been a recent resurgence in the area of explainable artificial intelligence as researchers and practitioners seek to provide more transparency to their algorithms. Much of this research is focused on explicitly explaining decisions or actions to a human observer, and it should not be controversial to say that looking at how humans explain to each other can serve as a useful starting point for explanation in artificial intelligence. However, it is fair to say that most work in explainable artificial intelligence uses only the researchers' intuition of what constitutes a 'good' explanation. There exist vast and valuable bodies of research in philosophy, psychology, and cognitive science of how people define, generate, select, evaluate, and present explanations, which argues that people employ certain cognitive biases and social expectations to the explanation process. This paper argues that the field of explainable artificial intelligence can build on this existing research, and reviews relevant papers from philosophy, cognitive psychology/science, and social psychology, which study these topics. It draws out some important findings, and discusses ways that these can be infused with work on explainable artificial intelligence. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

"Artificial intelligence in medicine","Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a general term that implies the use of a computer to model intelligent behavior with minimal human intervention. Al is generally accepted as having started with the invention of robots. The term derives from the Czech word robota, meaning biosynthetic machines used as forced labor. In this field, Leonardo Da Vinci's lasting heritage is today's burgeoning use of robotic-assisted surgery, named after him, for complex urologic and gynecologic procedures. Da Vinci's sketchbooks of robots helped set the stage for this innovation. AI, described as the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, was officially born in 1956. The term is applicable to a broad range of items in medicine such as robotics, medical diagnosis, medical statistics, and human biology up to and including today's ""omics"". AI in medicine, which is the focus of this review, has two main branches: virtual and physical. The virtual branch includes informatics approaches from deep learning information management to control of health management systems, including electronic health records, and active guidance of physicians in their treatment decisions. The physical branch is best represented by robots used to assist the elderly patient or the attending surgeon. Also embodied in this branch are targeted nanorobots, a unique new drug delivery system. The societal and ethical complexities of these applications require further reflection, proof of their medical utility, economic value, and development of interdisciplinary strategies for their wider application.

"Use of Artificial Intelligence in the Design of Small Peptide Antibiotics Effective against a Broad Spectrum of Highly Antibiotic-Resistant Superbugs","Increased multiple antibiotic resistance in the face of declining antibiotic discovery is one of society's most pressing health issues. Antimicrobial peptides represent a promising new class of antibiotics. Here we ask whether it is possible to make small broad spectrum peptides employing minimal assumptions, by capitalizing on accumulating chemical biology information. Using peptide array technology, two large random 9-amino-acid peptide libraries were iteratively created using the amino acid composition of the most active peptides. The resultant data was used together with Artificial Neural Networks, a powerful machine learning technique, to create quantitative in silico models of antibiotic activity. On the basis of random testing, these models proved remarkably effective in predicting the activity of 100,000 virtual peptides. The best peptides, representing the top quartile of predicted activities, were effective against a broad array of multidrug-resistant ""Superbugs"" with activities that were equal to or better than four highly used conventional antibiotics, more effective than the most advanced clinical candidate antimicrobial peptide, and protective against Staphylococcus aureus infections in animal models.","Cherkasov, A; Hilpert, K; Jenssen, H; Fjell, CD; Waldbrook, M; Mullaly, SC; Volkmer, R; Hancock, REW",2009,"ACS CHEMICAL BIOLOGY"

"Artificial intelligence in cancer imaging: Clinical challenges and applications","Judgement, as one of the core tenets of medicine, relies upon the integration of multilayered data with nuanced decision making. Cancer offers a unique context for medical decisions given not only its variegated forms with evolution of disease but also the need to take into account the individual condition of patients, their ability to receive treatment, and their responses to treatment. Challenges remain in the accurate detection, characterization, and monitoring of cancers despite improved technologies. Radiographic assessment of disease most commonly relies upon visual evaluations, the interpretations of which may be augmented by advanced computational analyses. In particular, artificial intelligence (AI) promises to make great strides in the qualitative interpretation of cancer imaging by expert clinicians, including volumetric delineation of tumors over time, extrapolation of the tumor genotype and biological course from its radiographic phenotype, prediction of clinical outcome, and assessment of the impact of disease and treatment on adjacent organs. AI may automate processes in the initial interpretation of images and shift the clinical workflow of radiographic detection, management decisions on whether or not to administer an intervention, and subsequent observation to a yet to be envisioned paradigm. Here, the authors review the current state of AI as applied to medical imaging of cancer and describe advances in 4 tumor types (lung, brain, breast, and prostate) to illustrate how common clinical problems are being addressed. Although most studies evaluating AI applications in oncology to date have not been vigorously validated for reproducibility and generalizability, the results do highlight increasingly concerted efforts in pushing AI technology to clinical use and to impact future directions in cancer care.","Bi, WL; Hosny, A; Schabath, MB; Giger, ML; Birkbak, NJ; Mehrtash, A; Allison, T; Arnaout, O; Abbosh, C; Dunn, IF; Mak, RH; Tamimi, RM; Tempany, CM; Swanton, C; Hoffmann, U; Schwartz, LH; Gillies, RJ; Huang, RY; Aerts, HJWL",2019,"CA-A CANCER JOURNAL FOR CLINICIANS"
"Automated analysis of protein NMR assignments using methods from artificial intelligence","An expert system for determining resonance assignments from NMR spectra of proteins is described. Given the amino acid sequence, a two-dimensional N-15-H-1 heteronuclear correlation spectrum and seven to eight three-dimensional triple-resonance NMR spectra for seven proteins, AUTOASSIGN obtained an average of 98% of sequence-specific spin-system assignments with an error rate of less than 0.5%. Execution times on a Sparc 10 workstation varied from 16 seconds for smaller proteins with simple spectra to one to nine minutes for medium size proteins exhibiting numerous extra spin systems attributed to conformational isomerization. AUTOASSIGN combines symbolic constraint satisfaction methods with a domain-specific knowledge base to exploit the logical structure of the sequential assignment problem, the specific features of the various NMR experiments, and the expected chemical shift frequencies of different amino acids. The current implementation specializes in the analysis of data derived from the most sensitive of the currently available triple-resonance experiments. Potential extensions of the system for analysis of additional types of protein NMR data are also discussed.

In addition to the traditional linear methods, several artificial-intelligence-based techniques are studied. These include linear, feed-forward, recurrent Elman and Radial Basis neural networks alongside the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference scheme. The problem is examined initially for the univariate case, and is extended to include additional meteorological parameters in the process of estimating the optimum model. The results indicate that the developed artificial intelligence models predict the solar radiation time series more effectively compared to the conventional procedures based on the clearness index.

"Fiber/Fabric-Based Piezoelectric and Triboelectric Nanogenerators for Flexible/Stretchable and Wearable Electronics and Artificial Intelligence","Integration of advanced nanogenerator technology with conventional textile processes fosters the emergence of textile-based nanogenerators (NGs), which will inevitably promote the rapid development and widespread applications of next-generation wearable electronics and multifaceted artificial intelligence systems. NGs endow smart textiles with mechanical energy harvesting and multifunctional self-powered sensing capabilities, while textiles provide a versatile flexible design carrier and extensive wearable application platform for their development. However, due to the lack of an effective interactive platform and communication channel between researchers specializing in NGs and those good at textiles, it is rather difficult to achieve fiber/fabric-based NGs with both excellent electrical output properties and outstanding textile-related performances. To this end, a critical review is presented on the current state of the arts of wearable fiber/fabric-based piezoelectric nanogenerators and triboelectric nanogenerators with respect to basic classifications, material selections, fabrication techniques, structural designs, and working principles, as well as potential applications. Furthermore, the potential difficulties and tough challenges that can impede their large-scale commercial applications are summarized and discussed.

"Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI): Concepts, taxonomies, opportunities and challenges toward responsible AI","In the last few years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has achieved a notable momentum that, if harnessed appropriately, may deliver the best of expectations over many application sectors across the field. For this to occur shortly in Machine Learning, the entire community stands in front of the barrier of explainability, an inherent problem of the latest techniques brought by sub-symbolism (e.g. ensembles or Deep Neural Networks) that were not present in the last hype of AI (namely, expert systems and rule based models). Paradigms underlying this problem fall within the so-called eXplainable AI (XAI) field, which is widely acknowledged as a crucial feature for the practical deployment of AI models. The overview presented in this article examines the existing literature and contributions already done in the field of XAI, including a prospect toward what is yet to be reached. For this purpose we summarize previous efforts made to define explainability in Machine Learning, establishing a novel definition of explainable Machine Learning that covers such prior conceptual propositions with a major focus on the audience for which the explainability is sought. Departing from this definition, we propose and discuss about a taxonomy of recent contributions related to the explainability of different Machine Learning models, including those aimed at explaining Deep Learning methods for which a second dedicated taxonomy is built and examined in detail. This critical literature analysis serves as the motivating background for a series of challenges faced by XAI, such as the interesting crossroads of data fusion and explainability. Our prospects lead toward the concept of Responsible Artificial Intelligence, namely, a methodology for the large-scale implementation of AI methods in real organizations with fairness, model explainability and accountability at its core. Our ultimate goal is to provide newcomers to the field of XAI with a thorough taxonomy that can serve as reference material in order to stimulate future research advances, but also to encourage experts and professionals from other disciplines to embrace the benefits of AI in their activity sectors, without any prior bias for its lack of interpretability.","Arrieta, AB; Diaz-Rodriguez, N; Del Ser, J; Bennetot, A; Tabik, S; Barbado, A; Garcia, S; Gil-Lopez, S; Molina, D; Benjamins, R; Chatila, R; Herrera, F",2020,"INFORMATION FUSION"
"A review of machining monitoring systems based on artificial intelligence process models","Many machining monitoring systems based on artificial intelligence (AI) process models have been successfully developed in the past for optimising, predicting or controlling machining processes. In general, these monitoring systems present important differences among them, and there are no clear guidelines for their implementation. In order to present a generic view of machining monitoring systems and facilitate their implementation, this paper reviews six key issues involved in the development of intelligent machining systems: (1) the different sensor systems applied to monitor machining processes, (2) the most effective signal processing techniques, (3) the most frequent sensory features applied in modelling machining processes, (4) the sensory feature selection and extraction methods for using relevant sensory information, (5) the design of experiments required to model a machining operation with the minimum amount of experimental data and (6) the main characteristics of several artificial intelligence techniques to facilitate their application/selection.","Abellan-Nebot, JV; Subiron, FR",2010,"INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY"
"Two hybrid Artificial Intelligence approaches for modeling rainfall-runoff process","The need for accurate modeling of the rainfall-runoff process has grown rapidly in the past decades. However, considering the high stochastic property of the process, many models are still being developed in order to define such a complex phenomenon. Recently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques such as the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and the Adaptive Neural-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) have been extensively used by hydrologists for rainfall-runoff modeling as well as for other fields of hydrology. In this paper, two hybrid AI-based models which are reliable in capturing the periodicity features of the process are introduced for watershed rainfall-runoff modeling. In the first model, the SARIMAX (Seasonal Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average with exogenous input)-ANN model, an ANN is used to find the non-linear relationship among the residuals of the fitted linear SARIMAX model. In the second model, the wavelet-ANFIS model, wavelet transform is linked to the ANFIS concept and the main time series of two variables (rainfall and runoff) are decomposed into some multi-frequency time series by wavelet transform. Afterwards, these time series are imposed as input data to the ANFIS to predict the runoff discharge one time step ahead. The obtained results of the models applications for the rainfall-runoff modeling of two watersheds (located in Azerbaijan, Iran) show that, although the proposed models can predict both short and long terms runoff discharges by considering seasonality effects, the second model is relatively more appropriate because it uses the multi-scale time series of rainfall and runoff data in the ANFIS input layer.

"Siri, Siri, in my hand: Who's the fairest in the land? On the interpretations, illustrations, and implications of artificial intelligence","Artificial intelligence (AI)-defined as a system's ability to correctly interpret external data, to learn from such data, and to use those learnings to achieve specific goals and tasks through flexible adaptation is a topic in nearly every boardroom and at many dinner tables. Yet, despite this prominence, Al-is still a surprisingly fuzzy concept and a lot of questions surrounding it are still open. In this article, we analyze how Al is different from related concepts, such as the Internet of Things and big data, and suggest that Al is not one monolithic term but instead needs to be seen in a more nuanced way. This can either be achieved by looking at Al through the lens of evolutionary stages (artificial narrow intelligence, artificial general intelligence, and artificial super intelligence) or by focusing on different types of Al systems (analytical Al, human-inspired AI, and humanized Al). Based on this classification, we show the potential and risk of Al using a series of case studies regarding universities, corporations, and governments. Finally, we present a framework that helps organizations think about the internal and external implications of AI, which we label the Three C Model of Confidence, Change, and Control.

"Artificial intelligence techniques for sizing photovoltaic systems: A review","Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are becoming useful as alternate approaches to conventional techniques or as components of integrated systems. They have been used to solve complicated practical problems in various areas and are becoming more and more popular nowadays. AI-techniques have the following features: can learn from examples; are fault tolerant in the sense that they are able to handle noisy and incomplete data; are able to deal with non-linear problems; and once trained can perform prediction and generalization at high speed. AI-based systems are being developed and deployed worldwide in a myriad of applications, mainly because of their symbolic reasoning, flexibility and explanation capabilities. AI have been used and applied in different sectors, such as engineering, economics, medicine, military, marine, etc. They have also been applied for modeling, identification, optimization, prediction, forecasting, and control of complex systems. The main objective of this paper is to present an overview of the AI-techniques for sizing photovoltaic (PV) systems: stand-alone PVs, grid-connected PV systems, PV-wind hybrid systems, etc. Published literature presented in this paper show the potential of AI as a design tool for the optimal sizing of PV systems. Additionally, the advantage of using an AI-based sizing of PV systems is that it provides good optimization, especially in isolated areas, where the weather data are not always available.

"The Artificial Intelligence Clinician learns optimal treatment strategies for sepsis in intensive care","Sepsis is the third leading cause of death worldwide and the main cause of mortality in hospitals(1-3), but the best treatment strategy remains uncertain. In particular, evidence suggests that current practices in the administration of intravenous fluids and vasopressors are suboptimal and likely induce harm in a proportion of patients(1,4-6). To tackle this sequential decision-making problem, we developed a reinforcement learning agent, the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Clinician, which extracted implicit knowledge from an amount of patient data that exceeds by many-fold the life-time experience of human clinicians and learned optimal treatment by analyzing a myriad of (mostly suboptimal) treatment decisions. We demonstrate that the value of the AI Clinician's selected treatment is on average reliably higher than human clinicians. In a large validation cohort independent of the training data, mortality was lowest in patients for whom clinicians' actual doses matched the AI decisions. Our model provides individualized and clinically interpretable treatment decisions for sepsis that could improve patient outcomes.","Komorowski, M; Celi, L; Badawi, O; Gordon, AC; Faisal, AA",2018,"NATURE MEDICINE"
"The forthcoming Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution: Its impact on society and firms","The impact of the industrial and digital (information) revolutions has, undoubtedly, been substantial on practically all aspects of our society, life, firms and employment. Will the forthcoming AI revolution produce similar, far-reaching effects? By examining analogous inventions of the industrial, digital and Al revolutions, this article claims that the latter is on target and that it would bring extensive changes that will also affect all aspects of our society and life. In addition, its impact on firms and employment will be considerable, resulting in richly interconnected organizations with decision making based on the analysis and exploitation of ""big"" data and intensified, global competition among firms. People will be capable of buying goods and obtaining services from anywhere in the world using the Internet, and exploiting the unlimited, additional benefits that will open through the widespread usage of AI inventions. The paper concludes that significant competitive advantages will continue to accrue to those utilizing the Internet widely and willing to take entrepreneurial risks in order to turn innovative products/services into worldwide commercial success stories. The greatest challenge facing societies and firms would be utilizing the benefits of availing AI technologies, providing vast opportunities for both new products/services and immense productivity improvements while avoiding the dangers and disadvantages in terms of increased unemployment and greater wealth inequalities.

"Artificial intelligence and deep learning in ophthalmology","Artificial intelligence (AI) based on deep learning (DL) has sparked tremendous global interest in recent years. DL has been widely adopted in image recognition, speech recognition and natural language processing, but is only beginning to impact on healthcare. In ophthalmology, DL has been applied to fundus photographs, optical coherence tomography and visual fields, achieving robust classification performance in the detection of diabetic retinopathy and retinopathy of prematurity, the glaucoma-like disc, macular oedema and age-related macular degeneration. DL in ocular imaging may be used in conjunction with telemedicine as a possible solution to screen, diagnose and monitor major eye diseases for patients in primary care and community settings. Nonetheless, there are also potential challenges with DL application in ophthalmology, including clinical and technical challenges, explainability of the algorithm results, medicolegal issues, and physician and patient acceptance of the AI 'black-box' algorithms. DL could potentially revolutionise how ophthalmology is practised in the future. This review provides a summary of the state-of-the-art DL systems described for ophthalmic applications, potential challenges in clinical deployment and the path forward.","Ting, DSW; Pasquale, LR; Peng, L; Campbell, JP; Lee, AY; Raman, R; Tan, GSW; Schmetterer, L; Keane, PA; Wong, TY",2019,"BRITISH JOURNAL OF OPHTHALMOLOGY"

"Methodologic Guide for Evaluating Clinical Performance and Effect of Artificial Intelligence Technology for Medical Diagnosis and Prediction","The use of artificial intelligence in medicine is currently an issue of great interest, especially with regard to the diagnostic or predictive analysis of medical images. Adoption of an artificial intelligence tool in clinical practice requires careful confirmation of its clinical utility. Herein, the authors explain key methodology points involved in a clinical evaluation of artificial intelligence technology for use in medicine, especially high-dimensional or overparameterized diagnostic or predictive models in which artificial deep neural networks are used, mainly from the standpoints of clinical epidemiology and biostatistics. First, statistical methods for assessing the discrimination and calibration performances of a diagnostic or predictive model are summarized. Next, the effects of disease manifestation spectrum and disease prevalence on the performance results are explained, followed by a discussion of the difference between evaluating the performance with use of internal and external datasets, the importance of using an adequate external dataset obtained from a well-defined clinical cohort to avoid overestimating the clinical performance as a result of overfitting in high-dimensional or overparameterized classification model and spectrum bias, and the essentials for achieving a more robust clinical evaluation. Finally, the authors review the role of clinical trials and observational outcome studies for ultimate clinical verification of diagnostic or predictive artificial intelligence tools through patient outcomes, beyond performance metrics, and how to design such studies.

"Application of artificial intelligence using a convolutional neural network for detecting gastric cancer in endoscopic images","Background Image recognition using artificial intelligence with deep learning through convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has dramatically improved and been increasingly applied to medical fields for diagnostic imaging. We developed a CNN that can automatically detect gastric cancer in endoscopic images. Methods A CNN-based diagnostic system was constructed based on Single Shot MultiBox Detector architecture and trained using 13,584 endoscopic images of gastric cancer. To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy, an independent test set of 2296 stomach images collected from 69 consecutive patients with 77 gastric cancer lesions was applied to the constructed CNN. Results The CNN required 47 s to analyze 2296 test images. The CNN correctly diagnosed 71 of 77 gastric cancer lesions with an overall sensitivity of 92.2%, and 161 non-cancerous lesions were detected as gastric cancer, resulting in a positive predictive value of 30.6%. Seventy of the 71 lesions 98.6%) with a diameter of 6 mm or more as well as all invasive cancers were correctly detected. All missed lesions were superficially depressed and differentiated-type intramucosal cancers that were difficult to distinguish from gastritis even for experienced endoscopists. Nearly half of the false-positive lesions were gastritis with changes in color tone or an irregular mucosal surface. Conclusion The constructed CNN system for detecting gastric cancer could process numerous stored endoscopic images in a very short time with a clinically relevant diagnostic ability. It may be well applicable to daily clinical practice to reduce the burden of endoscopists.","Hirasawa, T; Aoyama, K; Tanimoto, T; Ishihara, S; Shichijo, S; Ozawa, T; Ohnishi, T; Fujishiro, M; Matsuo, K; Fujisaki, J; Tada, T",2018,"GASTRIC CANCER"

"Knowledge warehouse: an architectural integration of knowledge management, decision support, artificial intelligence and data warehousing","Decision support systems (DSS) are becoming increasingly more critical to the daily operation of organizations. Data warehousing, an integral part of this, provides an infrastructure that enables businesses to extract, cleanse, and store vast amounts of data. The basic purpose of a data warehouse is to empower the knowledge workers with information that allows them to make decisions based on a solid foundation of fact, However, only a fraction of the needed information exists on computers; the vast majority of a firm's intellectual assets exist as knowledge in the minds of its employees. What is needed is a new generation of knowledge-enabled systems that provides the infrastructure needed to capture, cleanse, store, organize, leverage, and disseminate not only data and information but also the knowledge of the firm. The purpose of this paper is to propose, as an extension to the data warehouse model, a knowledge warehouse (KW) architecture that will not only facilitate the capturing and coding of knowledge but also enhance the retrieval and sharing of knowledge across the organization. The knowledge warehouse proposed here suggests a different direction for DSS in the next decade, This new direction is based on an expanded purpose of DSS. That is, the purpose of DSS in knowledge improvement. This expanded purpose of DSS also suggests that the effectiveness of a DSS will, in the future, be measured based on how well it promotes and enhances knowledge, how well it improves the mental model(s) and understanding of the decision maker(s) and thereby how well it improves his/her decision making.

"A review of artificial intelligence based building energy use prediction: Contrasting the capabilities of single and ensemble prediction models","Building energy use prediction plays an important role in building energy management and conservation as it can help us to evaluate building energy efficiency, conduct building commissioning, and detect and diagnose building system faults. Building energy prediction can be broadly classified into engineering, Artificial Intelligence (AI) based, and hybrid approaches. While engineering and hybrid approaches use thermodynamic equations to estimate energy use, the AI-based approach uses historical data to predict future energy use under constraints. Owing to the ease of use and adaptability to seek optimal solutions in a rapid manner, the AI-based approach has gained popularity in recent years. For this reason and to discuss recent developments in the AI based approaches for building energy use prediction, this paper conducts an in-depth review of single AI-based methods such as multiple linear regression, artificial neural networks, and support vector regression, and ensemble prediction method that, by combining multiple single AI-based prediction models improves the prediction accuracy manifold.

"Screening for cardiac contractile dysfunction using an artificial intelligence-enabled electrocardiogram","Asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction (ALVD) is present in 3-6% of the general population, is associated with reduced quality of life and longevity, and is treatable when found(1-4). An inexpensive, noninvasive screening tool for ALVD in the doctor's office is not available. We tested the hypothesis that application of artificial intelligence (AI) to the electrocardiogram (ECG), a routine method of measuring the heart's electrical activity, could identify ALVD. Using paired 12-lead ECG and echocardiogram data, including the left ventricular ejection fraction (a measure of contractile function), from 44,959 patients at the Mayo Clinic, we trained a convolutional neural network to identify patients with ventricular dysfunction, defined as ejection fraction <= 35%, using the ECG data alone. When tested on an independent set of 52,870 patients, the network model yielded values for the area under the curve, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 0.93, 86.3%, 85.7%, and 85.7%, respectively. In patients without ventricular dysfunction, those with a positive AI screen were at 4 times the risk (hazard ratio, 4.1; 95% confidence interval, 3.3 to 5.0) of developing future ventricular dysfunction compared with those with a negative screen. Application of AI to the ECG-a ubiquitous, low-cost test-permits the ECG to serve as a powerful screening tool in asymptomatic individuals to identify ALVD.","Attia, ZI; Kapa, S; Lopez-Jimenez, F; McKie, PM; Ladewig, DJ; Satam, G; Pellikka, PA; Enriquez-Sarano, M; Noseworthy, PA; Munger, TM; Asirvatham, SJ; Scott, CG; Carter, RE; Friedman, PA",2019,"NATURE MEDICINE"

"Artificial intelligence-enabled rapid diagnosis of patients with COVID-19","For diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a SARS-CoV-2 virus-specific reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test is routinely used. However, this test can take up to 2 d to complete, serial testing may be required to rule out the possibility of false negative results and there is currently a shortage of RT-PCR test kits, underscoring the urgent need for alternative methods for rapid and accurate diagnosis of patients with COVID-19. Chest computed tomography (CT) is a valuable component in the evaluation of patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nevertheless, CT alone may have limited negative predictive value for ruling out SARS-CoV-2 infection, as some patients may have normal radiological findings at early stages of the disease. In this study, we used artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to integrate chest CT findings with clinical symptoms, exposure history and laboratory testing to rapidly diagnose patients who are positive for COVID-19. Among a total of 905 patients tested by real-time RT-PCR assay and next-generation sequencing RT-PCR, 419 (46.3%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In a test set of 279 patients, the AI system achieved an area under the curve of 0.92 and had equal sensitivity as compared to a senior thoracic radiologist. The AI system also improved the detection of patients who were positive for COVID-19 via RT-PCR who presented with normal CT scans, correctly identifying 17 of 25 (68%) patients, whereas radiologists classified all of these patients as COVID-19 negative. When CT scans and associated clinical history are available, the proposed AI system can help to rapidly diagnose COVID-19 patients.

"DeepStack: Expert-level artificial intelligence in heads-up no-limit poker","Artificial intelligence has seen several breakthroughs in recent years, with games often serving as milestones. A common feature of these games is that players have perfect information. Poker, the quintessential game of imperfect information, is a long-standing challenge problem in artificial intelligence. We introduce DeepStack, an algorithm for imperfect-information settings. It combines recursive reasoning to handle information asymmetry, decomposition to focus computation on the relevant decision, and a formof intuition that is automatically learned from self-play using deep learning. In a study involving 44,000 hands of poker, DeepStack defeated, with statistical significance, professional poker players in heads-up no-limit Texas hold'em. The approach is theoretically sound and is shown to produce strategies that are more difficult to exploit than prior approaches.","Moravcik, M; Schmid, M; Burch, N; Lisy, V; Morrill, D; Bard, N; Davis, T; Waugh, K; Johanson, M; Bowling, M",2017,"SCIENCE"
"Modeling heating and cooling loads by artificial intelligence for energy-efficient building design","The energy performance of buildings was estimated using various data mining techniques, including support vector regression (SVR), artificial neural network (ANN), classification and regression tree, chi-, squared automatic interaction detector, general linear regression, and ensemble inference model. The prediction models were constructed using 768 experimental datasets from the literature with 8 input parameters and 2 output parameters (cooling load (CL) and heating load (HL)). Comparison results showed that the ensemble approach (SVR +ANN) and SVR were the best models for predicting CL and HL, respectively, with mean absolute percentage errors below 4%. Compared to previous works, the ensemble model and SVR model further obtained at least 39.0% to 65.9% lower root mean square errors, respectively, for CL and HL prediction. This study confirms the efficiency, effectiveness, and accuracy of the proposed approach when predicting CL and HL in building design stage. The analytical results support the feasibility of using the proposed techniques to facilitate early designs of energy conserving buildings. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

"An artificial intelligence-enabled ECG algorithm for the identification of patients with atrial fibrillation during sinus rhythm: a retrospective analysis of outcome prediction","Background Atrial fibrillation is frequently asymptomatic and thus underdetected but is associated with stroke, heart failure, and death. Existing screening methods require prolonged monitoring and are limited by cost and low yield. We aimed to develop a rapid, inexpensive, point-of-care means of identifying patients with atrial fibrillation using machine learning. Methods We developed an artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled electrocardiograph (ECG) using a convolutional neural network to detect the electrocardiographic signature of atrial fibrillation present during normal sinus rhythm using standard 10-second, 12-lead ECGs. We included all patients aged 18 years or older with at least one digital, normal sinus rhythm, standard 10-second, 12-lead ECG acquired in the supine position at the Mayo Clinic ECG laboratory between Dec 31, 1993, and July 21, 2017, with rhythm labels validated by trained personnel under cardiologist supervision. We classified patients with at least one ECG with a rhythm of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter as positive for atrial fibrillation. We allocated ECGs to the training, internal validation, and testing datasets in a 7: 1: 2 ratio. We calculated the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operatoring characteristic curve for the internal validation dataset to select a probability threshold, which we applied to the testing dataset. We evaluated model performance on the testing dataset by calculating the AUC and the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score with two-sided 95% CIs. Findings We included 180 922 patients with 649 931 normal sinus rhythm ECGs for analysis: 454 789 ECGs recorded from 126 526 patients in the training dataset, 64 340 ECGs from 18 116 patients in the internal validation dataset, and 130 802 ECGs from 36 280 patients in the testing dataset. 3051 (8.4%) patients in the testing dataset had verified atrial fibrillation before the normal sinus rhythm ECG tested by the model. A single AI-enabled ECG identified atrial fibrillation with an AUC of 0.87 (95% CI 0.86-0.88), sensitivity of 79.0% (77.5-80.4), specificity of 79.5% (79.0-79.9), F1 score of 39.2% (38.1-40.3), and overall accuracy of 79.4% (79.0-79.9). Including all ECGs acquired during the first month of each patient's window of interest (ie, the study start date or 31 days before the first recorded atrial fibrillation ECG) increased the AUC to 0.90 (0.90-0.91), sensitivity to 82.3% (80.9-83.6), specificity to 83.4% (83.0-83.8), F1 score to 45.4% (44.2-46.5), and overall accuracy to 83.3% (83.0-83.7). Interpretation An AI-enabled ECG acquired during normal sinus rhythm permits identification at point of care of individuals with atrial fibrillation. Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

"v Machine learning & artificial intelligence in the quantum domain: a review of recent progress","Quantum information technologies, on the one hand, and intelligent learning systems, on the other, are both emergent technologies that are likely to have a transformative impact on our society in the future. The respective underlying fields of basic research-quantum information versus machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI)-have their own specific questions and challenges, which have hitherto been investigated largely independently. However, in a growing body of recent work, researchers have been probing the question of the extent to which these fields can indeed learn and benefit from each other. Quantum ML explores the interaction between quantum computing and ML, investigating how results and techniques from one field can be used to solve the problems of the other. Recently we have witnessed significant breakthroughs in both directions of influence. For instance, quantum computing is finding a vital application in providing speed-ups for ML problems, critical in our ` big data' world. Conversely, ML already permeates many cutting-edge technologies and may become instrumental in advanced quantum technologies. Aside from quantum speed-up in data analysis, or classical ML optimization used in quantum experiments, quantum enhancements have also been (theoretically) demonstrated for interactive learning tasks, highlighting the potential of quantum-enhanced learning agents. Finally, works exploring the use of AI for the very design of quantum experiments and for performing parts of genuine research autonomously, have reported their first successes. Beyond the topics of mutual enhancement-exploring what ML/AI can do for quantum physics and vice versaresearchers have also broached the fundamental issue of quantum generalizations of learning and AI concepts. This deals with questions of the very meaning of learning and intelligence in a world that is fully described by quantum mechanics. In this review, we describe the main ideas, recent developments and progress in a broad spectrum of research investigating ML and AI in the quantum domain.","Dunjko, V; Briegel, HJ",2018,"REPORTS ON PROGRESS IN PHYSICS"
"Artificial intelligence in retina","Major advances in diagnostic technologies are offering unprecedented insight into the condition of the retina and beyond ocular disease. Digital images providing millions of morphological datasets can fast and non-invasively be analyzed in a comprehensive manner using artificial intelligence (AI). Methods based on machine learning (ML) and particularly deep learning (DL) are able to identify, localize and quantify pathological features in almost every macular and retinal disease. Convolutional neural networks thereby mimic the path of the human brain for object recognition through learning of pathological features from training sets, supervised ML, or even extrapolation from patterns recognized independently, unsupervised ML. The methods of AI-based retinal analyses are diverse and differ widely in their applicability, interpretability and reliability in different datasets and diseases. Fully automated AI-based systems have recently been approved for screening of diabetic retinopathy (DR). The overall potential of ML/DL includes screening, diagnostic grading as well as guidance of therapy with automated detection of disease activity, recurrences, quantification of therapeutic effects and identification of relevant targets for novel therapeutic approaches. Prediction and prognostic conclusions further expand the potential benefit of AI in retina which will enable personalized health care as well as large scale management and will empower the ophthalmologist to provide high quality diagnosis/therapy and successfully deal with the complexity of 21st century ophthalmology.","Schmidt-Erfurth, U; Sadeghipour, A; Gerendas, BS; Waldstein, SM; Bogunovic, H",2018,"PROGRESS IN RETINAL AND EYE RESEARCH"
"Hybrid artificial intelligence approach based on neural fuzzy inference model and metaheuristic optimization for flood susceptibilitgy modeling in a high-frequency tropical cyclone area using GIS","This paper proposes a new artificial intelligence approach based on neural fuzzy inference system and metaheuristic optimization for flood susceptibility modeling, namely MONF. In the new approach, the neural fuzzy inference system was used to create an initial flood susceptibility model and then the model was optimized using two metaheuristic algorithms, Evolutionary Genetic and Particle Swarm Optimization. A high-frequency tropical cyclone area of the Tuong Duong district in Central Vietnam was used as a case study. First, a GIS database for the study area was constructed. The database that includes 76 historical flood inundated areas and ten flood influencing factors was used to develop and validate the proposed model. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, and area under the ROC curve (AUC) were used to assess the model performance and its prediction capability. Experimental results showed that the proposed model has high performance on both the training (RMSE = 0.306, MAE = 0.094, AUC = 0.962) and validation dataset (RMSE = 0.362, MAE = 0.130, AUC = 0.911). The usability of the proposed model was evaluated by comparing with those obtained from state-of-the art benchmark soft computing techniques such as J48 Decision Tree, Random Forest, Multi-layer Perceptron Neural Network, Support Vector Machine, and Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System. The results show that the proposed MONF model outperforms the above benchmark models; we conclude that the MONF model is a new alternative tool that should be used in flood susceptibility mapping. The result in this study is useful for planners and decision makers for sustainable management of flood-prone areas. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

"Densities of ammonium and phosphonium based deep eutectic solvents: Prediction using artificial intelligence and group contribution techniques","As applications of deep eutectic solvents are growing fast as green alternatives, prediction of physical properties data for such systems becomes a necessity for engineering application designs and new process developments. In this study, densities of three classes of deep eutectic solvents, based on a phosphonium and two ammonium salts, were measured. Two predictive models based on artificial intelligence and group contribution methods were proposed for accurate estimation and evaluation of deep eutectic solvent densities. A feed forward back propagation neural network with 9 hidden neurons was successfully developed and trained with the measured density data. The group contribution method applied the modified Lydersen-Joback-Reid, Lee-Kesler and the modified Rackett equations. The comparison of the predicted densities with those obtained by measurement confirmed the reliability of the neural network and the group contribution method with average absolute errors of 0.14 and 2.03%, respectively. Comparison of the model performances indicated a better predictability of the developed neural network over the group contribution method. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

"Real-Time Use of Artificial Intelligence in Identification of Diminutive Polyps During Colonoscopy A Prospective Study","Background: Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) for colonoscopy may help endoscopists distinguish neoplastic polyps (adenomas) requiring resection from nonneoplastic polyps not requiring resection, potentially reducing cost. Objective: To evaluate the performance of real-time CAD with endocytoscopes (x520 ultramagnifying colonoscopes providing microvascular and cellular visualization of colorectal polyps after application of the narrow-band imaging [NBI] and methylene blue staining modes, respectively). Design: Single-group, open-label, prospective study. (UMIN [University hospital Medical Information Network] Clinical Trial Registry: UMIN000027360). Setting: University hospital. Participants: 791 consecutive patients undergoing colonoscopy and 23 endoscopists. Intervention: Real-time use of CAD during colonoscopy. Measurements: CAD-predicted pathology (neoplastic or nonneoplastic) of detected diminutive polyps (5 mm) on the basis of real-time outputs compared with pathologic diagnosis of the resected specimen (gold standard). The primary end point was whether CAD with the stained mode produced a negative predictive value (NPV) of 90% or greater for identifying diminutive rectosigmoid adenomas, the threshold required to ""diagnose-and-leave"" nonneoplastic polyps. Best- and worst-case scenarios assumed that polyps lacking either CAD diagnosis or pathology were true- or false-positive or true- or false-negative, respectively. Results: Overall, 466 diminutive (including 250 rectosigmoid) polyps from 325 patients were assessed by CAD, with a pathologic prediction rate of 98.1% (457 of 466). The NPVs of CAD for diminutive rectosigmoid adenomas were 96.4% (95% CI, 91.8% to 98.8%) (best-case scenario) and 93.7% (CI, 88.3% to 97.1%) (worst-case scenario) with stained mode and 96.5% (CI, 92.1% to 98.9%) (best-case scenario) and 95.2% (CI, 90.3% to 98.0%) (worst-case scenario) with NBI. Limitation: Two thirds of the colonoscopies were conducted by experts who had each experienced more than 200 endocytoscopies; 186 polyps not assessed by CAD were excluded. Conclusion: Real-time CAD can achieve the performance level required for a diagnose-and-leave strategy for diminutive, nonneoplastic rectosigmoid polyps.","Mori, Y; Kudo, SE; Misawa, M; Saito, Y; Ikematsu, H; Hotta, K; Ohtsuka, K; Urushibara, F; Kataoka, S; Ogawa, Y; Maeda, Y; Takeda, K; Nakamura, H; Ichimasa, K; Kudo, T; Hayashi, T; Wakamura, K; Ishida, F; Inoue, H; Itoh, H; Oda, M; Mori, K",2018,"ANNALS OF INTERNAL MEDICINE"
"Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Artificial Intelligence Revolutionizing Wildlife Monitoring and Conservation","Surveying threatened and invasive species to obtain accurate population estimates is an important but challenging task that requires a considerable investment in time and resources. Estimates using existing ground-based monitoring techniques, such as camera traps and surveys performed on foot, are known to be resource intensive, potentially inaccurate and imprecise, and difficult to validate. Recent developments in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), artificial intelligence and miniaturized thermal imaging systems represent a new opportunity for wildlife experts to inexpensively survey relatively large areas. The system presented in this paper includes thermal image acquisition as well as a video processing pipeline to perform object detection, classification and tracking of wildlife in forest or open areas. The system is tested on thermal video data from ground based and test flight footage, and is found to be able to detect all the target wildlife located in the surveyed area. The system is flexible in that the user can readily define the types of objects to classify and the object characteristics that should be considered during classification.","Gonzalez, LF; Montes, GA; Puig, E; Johnson, S; Mengersen, K; Gaston, KJ",2016,"SENSORS"

To realize this diverse set of applications, CR researchers leverage a variety of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. To help researchers better understand the practical implications of AI to their CR designs, this paper reviews several CR implementations that used the following AI techniques: artificial neural networks (ANNs), meta-heuristic algorithms, hidden Markov models (HMMs), rule-based systems, ontology-based systems (OBSs), and case-based systems (CBSs). Factors that influence the choice of AI techniques, such as responsiveness, complexity, security, robustness, and stability, are discussed.

"A comparison of various artificial intelligence approaches performance for estimating suspended sediment load of river systems: a case study in United States","Accurate and reliable suspended sediment load (SSL) prediction models are necessary for planning and management of water resource structures. More recently, soft computing techniques have been used in hydrological and environmental modeling. The present paper compared the accuracy of three different soft computing methods, namely, artificial neural networks (ANNs), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), coupled wavelet and neural network (WANN), and conventional sediment rating curve (SRC) approaches for estimating the daily SSL in two gauging stations in the USA. The performances of these models were measured by the coefficient of correlation (R), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (CE), rootmean- square error (RMSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) to choose the best fit model. Obtained results demonstrated that applied soft computing models were in good agreement with the observed SSL values, while they depicted better results than the conventional SRC method. The comparison of estimation accuracies of various models illustrated that the WANN was the most accurate model in SSL estimation in comparison to other models. For example, in Flathead River station, the determination coefficient was 0.91 for the best WANN model, while it was 0.65, 0.75, and 0.481 for the best ANN, ANFIS, and SRC models, and also in the Santa Clara River, amounts of this statistical criteria was 0.92 for the bestWANN model, while it was 0.76, 0.78, and 0.39 for the best ANN, ANFIS, and SRC models, respectively. Also, the values of cumulative suspended sediment load computed by the bestWANN model were closer to the observed data than the other models. In general, results indicated that the WANN model could satisfactorily mimic phenomenon, acceptably estimate cumulative SSL, and reasonably predict peak SSL values.","Olyaie, E; Banejad, H; Chau, KW; Melesse, AM",2015,"ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT"

"Tea quality prediction using a tin oxide-based electronic nose: an artificial intelligence approach","In this paper, we have (analyzed using a metal oxide sensor (MOS)-based electronic nose (EN)) five tea samples with different qualities, namely, drier month, drier month again over-fired, well-fermented normal fired in oven, well-fermented over-fired in oven, and under-fermented normal fired in oven. The flavour of tea is determined mainly by its taste and smell, which are determined by hundreds of volatile organic compounds (VOC) and non-volatile organic compounds present in tea. Tea flavour is traditionally measured through the use of a combination of conventional analytical instrumentation and human organoleptic profiling panels. These methods are expensive in terms of for example time and labour. The methods are also inaccurate because of a lack of either sensitivity or quantitative information. In this paper an investigation has been made to determine the flavours of different tea samples using an EN and thus to explore the possibility of replacing existing analytical and profiling panel methods. The technique uses an array of four MOSs, each of, which has an electrical resistance that has partial sensitivity to the headspace of tea. The signals from the sensor array are then conditioned by suitable interface circuitry resulting in our tea data-set. The data were processed using principal component analysis (PCA), fuzzy C means (FCM) algorithm. The data were then analyzed following the neural network paradigms, following the self-organizing map (SOM) method along with radial basis function (RBF) network and probabilistic neural network (PNN) classifier. Using FCM and SOM feature extraction techniques along with RBF neural network, we achieved 100% correct classification for the five different tea samples, each of which have different qualities. These results prove that our EN is capable of discriminating between the flavours of teas manufactured under different processing conditions, viz. over-fermented, over-fired, under-fermented, etc. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

"Causability and explainability of artificial intelligence in medicine","Explainable artificial intelligence (AI) is attracting much interest in medicine. Technically, the problem of explainability is as old as AI itself and classic AI represented comprehensible retraceable approaches. However, their weakness was in dealing with uncertainties of the real world. Through the introduction of probabilistic learning, applications became increasingly successful, but increasingly opaque. Explainable AI deals with the implementation of transparency and traceability of statistical black-box machine learning methods, particularly deep learning (DL). We argue that there is a need to go beyond explainable AI. To reach a level of explainable medicine we need causability. In the same way that usability encompasses measurements for the quality of use, causability encompasses measurements for the quality of explanations. In this article, we provide some necessary definitions to discriminate between explainability and causability as well as a use-case of DL interpretation and of human explanation in histopathology. The main contribution of this article is the notion of causability, which is differentiated from explainability in that causability is a property of a person, while explainability is a property of a system This article is categorized under: Fundamental Concepts of Data and Knowledge > Human Centricity and User Interaction","Holzinger, A; Langs, G; Denk, H; Zatloukal, K; Muller, H",2019,"WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY"
"Daily water level forecasting using wavelet decomposition and artificial intelligence techniques","Reliable water level forecasting for reservoir inflow is essential for reservoir operation. The objective of this paper is to develop and apply two hybrid models for daily water level forecasting and investigate their accuracy. These two hybrid models are wavelet-based artificial neural network (WANN) and wavelet-based adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (WANFIS). Wavelet decomposition is employed to decompose an input time series into approximation and detail components. The decomposed time series are used as inputs to artificial neural networks (ANN) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) for WANN and WANFIS models, respectively. Based on statistical performance indexes, the WANN and WANFIS models are found to produce better efficiency than the ANN and ANFIS models. WANFIS7-sym10 yields the best performance among all other models. It is found that wavelet decomposition improves the accuracy of ANN and ANFIS. This study evaluates the accuracy of the WANN and WANFIS models for different mother wavelets, including Daubechies, Symmlet and Coiflet wavelets. It is found that the model performance is dependent on input sets and mother wavelets, and the wavelet decomposition using mother wavelet, db 10, can further improve the efficiency of ANN and ANFIS models. Results obtained from this study indicate that the conjunction of wavelet decomposition and artificial intelligence models can be a useful tool for accurate forecasting daily water level and can yield better efficiency than the conventional forecasting models.

"Key challenges for delivering clinical impact with artificial intelligence","Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) research in healthcare is accelerating rapidly, with potential applications being demonstrated across various domains of medicine. However, there are currently limited examples of such techniques being successfully deployed into clinical practice. This article explores the main challenges and limitations of AI in healthcare, and considers the steps required to translate these potentially transformative technologies from research to clinical practice. Main body: Key challenges for the translation of AI systems in healthcare include those intrinsic to the science of machine learning, logistical difficulties in implementation, and consideration of the barriers to adoption as well as of the necessary sociocultural or pathway changes. Robust peer-reviewed clinical evaluation as part of randomised controlled trials should be viewed as the gold standard for evidence generation, but conducting these in practice may not always be appropriate or feasible. Performance metrics should aim to capture real clinical applicability and be understandable to intended users. Regulation that balances the pace of innovation with the potential for harm, alongside thoughtful post-market surveillance, is required to ensure that patients are not exposed to dangerous interventions nor deprived of access to beneficial innovations. Mechanisms to enable direct comparisons of AI systems must be developed, including the use of independent, local and representative test sets. Developers of AI algorithms must be vigilant to potential dangers, including dataset shift, accidental fitting of confounders, unintended discriminatory bias, the challenges of generalisation to new populations, and the unintended negative consequences of new algorithms on health outcomes. Conclusion: The safe and timely translation of AI research into clinically validated and appropriately regulated systems that can benefit everyone is challenging. Robust clinical evaluation, using metrics that are intuitive to clinicians and ideally go beyond measures of technical accuracy to include quality of care and patient outcomes, is essential. Further work is required (1) to identify themes of algorithmic bias and unfairness while developing mitigations to address these, (2) to reduce brittleness and improve generalisability, and (3) to develop methods for improved interpretability of machine learning predictions. If these goals can be achieved, the benefits for patients are likely to be transformational.","Kelly, CJ; Karthikesalingam, A; Suleyman, M; Corrado, G; King, D",2019,"BMC MEDICINE"
"Edge Intelligence: Paving the Last Mile of Artificial Intelligence With Edge Computing","With the breakthroughs in deep learning, the recent years have witnessed a booming of artificial intelligence (AI) applications and services, spanning from personal assistant to recommendation systems to video/audio surveillance. More recently, with the proliferation of mobile computing and Internet of Things (IoT), billions of mobile and IoT devices are connected to the Internet, generating zillions bytes of data at the network edge. Driving by this trend, there is an urgent need to push the AI frontiers to the network edge so as to fully unleash the potential of the edge big data. To meet this demand, edge computing, an emerging paradigm that pushes computing tasks and services from the network core to the network edge, has been widely recognized as a promising solution. The resulted new interdiscipline, edge AI or edge intelligence (EI), is beginning to receive a tremendous amount of interest. However, research on EI is still in its infancy stage, and a dedicated venue for exchanging the recent advances of EI is highly desired by both the computer system and AI communities. To this end, we conduct a comprehensive survey of the recent research efforts on EI. Specifically, we first review the background and motivation for AI running at the network edge. We then provide an overview of the overarching architectures, frameworks, and emerging key technologies for deep learning model toward training/inference at the network edge. Finally, we discuss future research opportunities on EI.

"State of the art artificial intelligence-based MPPT techniques for mitigating partial shading effects on PV systems - A review","Given the considerable recent attention to distributed power generation and interest in sustainable energy, the integration of photovoltaic (PV) systems to grid-connected or isolated microgrids has become widespread. In order to maximize power output of PV system extensive research into control strategies for maximum power point tracking (MPPT) methods has been conducted. According to the robust, reliable, and fast performance of artificial intelligence-based MPPT methods, these approaches have been applied recently to various systems under different conditions. Given the diversity of recent advances to MPPT approaches a review focusing on the performance and reliability of these methods under diverse conditions is required. This paper reviews AI-based techniques proven to be effective and feasible to implement and very common in literature for MPPT, including their limitations and advantages. In order to support researchers in application of the reviewed techniques this study is not limited to reviewing the performance of recently adopted methods, rather discusses the background theory, application to MPPT systems, and important references relating to each method. It is envisioned that this review can be a valuable resource for researchers and engineers working with PV-based power systems to be able to access the basic theory behind each method, select the appropriate method according to project requirements, and implement MPPT systems to fulfill project objectives.

"Artificial intelligence in digital pathology - new tools for diagnosis and precision oncology","In the past decade, advances in precision oncology have resulted in an increased demand for predictive assays that enable the selection and stratification of patients for treatment. The enormous divergence of signalling and transcriptional networks mediating the crosstalk between cancer, stromal and immune cells complicates the development of functionally relevant biomarkers based on a single gene or protein. However, the result of these complex processes can be uniquely captured in the morphometric features of stained tissue specimens. The possibility of digitizing whole-slide images of tissue has led to the advent of artificial intelligence (Al) and machine learning tools in digital pathology, which enable mining of subvisual morphometric phenotypes and might, ultimately, improve patient management. In this Perspective, we critically evaluate various AI-based computational approaches for digital pathology, focusing on deep neural networks and 'hand-crafted' feature-based methodologies. We aim to provide a broad framework for incorporating Al and machine learning tools into clinical oncology, with an emphasis on biomarker development. We discuss some of the challenges relating to the use of Al, including the need for well-curated validation datasets, regulatory approval and fair reimbursement strategies. Finally, we present potential future opportunities for precision oncology.","Bera, K; Schalper, KA; Rimm, DL; Velcheti, V; Madabhushi, A",2019,"NATURE REVIEWS CLINICAL ONCOLOGY"
"Evaluation and accurate diagnoses of pediatric diseases using artificial intelligence","Artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods have emerged as powerful tools to transform medical care. Although machine learning classifiers (MLCs) have already demonstrated strong performance in image-based diagnoses, analysis of diverse and massive electronic health record (EHR) data remains challenging. Here, we show that MLCs can query EHRs in a manner similar to the hypothetico-deductive reasoning used by physicians and unearth associations that previous statistical methods have not found. Our model applies an automated natural language processing system using deep learning techniques to extract clinically relevant information from EHRs. In total, 101.6 million data points from 1,362,559 pediatric patient visits presenting to a major referral center were analyzed to train and validate the framework. Our model demonstrates high diagnostic accuracy across multiple organ systems and is comparable to experienced pediatricians in diagnosing common childhood diseases. Our study provides a proof of concept for implementing an AI-based system as a means to aid physicians in tackling large amounts of data, augmenting diagnostic evaluations, and to provide clinical decision support in cases of diagnostic uncertainty or complexity. Although this impact may be most evident in areas where healthcare providers are in relative shortage, the benefits of such an AI system are likely to be universal.","Liang, HY; Tsui, BY; Ni, H; Valentim, CCS; Baxter, SL; Liu, G; Cai, WJ; Kermany, DS; Sun, X; Chen, JC; He, LY; Zhu, J; Tian, P; Shao, H; Zheng, LH; Hou, R; Hewett, S; Li, G; Liang, P; Zang, X; Zhang, ZQ; Pan, LY; Cai, HM; Ling, RJ; Li, SH; Cui, YW; Tang, SS; Ye, H; Huang, XY; He, W; Liang, WQ; Zhang, Q; Jiang, J; Yu, W; Gao, JQ; Ou, WX; Deng, YM; Hou, QZ; Wang, B; Yao, CC; Liang, Y; Zhang, S; Duan, Y; Zhang, RZ; Gibson, S; Zhang, CL; Li, OL; Zhang, ED; Karin, G; Nguyen, N; Wu, XK; Wen, C; Xu, J; Xu, W; Wang, BC; Wang, W; Li, J; Pizzato, B; Bao, C; Xiang, DM; He, WT; He, SQ; Zhou, YG; Haw, W; Goldbaum, M; Tremoulet, A; Hsu, CN; Carter, H; Zhu, L; Zhang, K; Xia, HM",2019,"NATURE MEDICINE"

"Real conversations with artificial intelligence: A comparison between human-human online conversations and human-chatbot conversations","This study analyzed how communication changes when people communicate with an intelligent agent as opposed to with another human. We compared 100 instant messaging conversations to 100 exchanges with the popular chatbot Cleverbot along seven dimensions: words per message, words per conversation, messages per conversation, word uniqueness, and use of profanity, shorthand, and emoticons. A MANOVA indicated that people communicated with the chatbot for longer durations (but with shorter messages) than they did with another human. Additionally, human-chatbot communication lacked much of the richness of vocabulary found in conversations among people, and exhibited greater profanity. These results suggest that while human language skills transfer easily to human-chatbot communication, there are notable differences in the content and quality of such conversations.

"A SURVEY ON TEMPORAL REASONING IN ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE","The notion of time is uniquitous in any activity that requires intelligence. In particular, several important notions like change, causality, action are described in terms of time. Therefore, the representation of time and reasoning about time is of crucial importance for many Artificial Intelligence systems. Specifically during the last 10 years, it has been attracting the attention of many Al researchers. In this survey, the results of this work are analysed. Firstly, Temporal Reasoning is defined. Then, the most important representational issues which determine a Temporal Reasoning approach are introduced: the logical form on which the approach is based, the ontology (the units taken as primitives, the temporal relations, the algorithms that have been developed,...) and the concepts related with reasoning about action (the representation of change, causality, action,...). For each issue the different choices in the literature are discussed.","VILA, L",1994,"AI COMMUNICATIONS"

"Artificial intelligence and the future of work: Human-Al symbiosis in organizational decision making","Artificial intelligence (Al) has penetrated many organizational processes, resulting in a growing fear that smart machines will soon replace many humans in decision making. To provide a more proactive and pragmatic perspective, this article highlights the complementarity of humans and Al and examines how each can bring their own strength in organizational decision-making processes typically characterized by uncertainty, complexity, and equivocality. With a greater computational information processing capacity and an analytical approach, Al can extend humans' cognition when addressing complexity, whereas humans can still offer a more holistic, intuitive approach in dealing with uncertainty and equivocality in organizational decision making. This premise mirrors the idea of intelligence augmentation, which states that Al systems should be designed with the intention of augmenting, not replacing, human contributions.

"Artificial Intelligence in Medical Practice: The Question to the Answer?","Computer science advances and ultra-fast computing speeds find artificial intelligence (AI) broadly benefitting modern society-forecasting weather, recognizing faces, detecting fraud, and deciphering genomics. AI's future role in medical practice remains an unanswered question. Machines (computers) learn to detect patterns not decipherable using biostatistics by processing massive datasets (big data) through layered mathematical models (algorithms). Correcting algorithm mistakes (training) adds to AI predictive model confidence. AI is being successfully applied for image analysis in radiology, pathology, and dermatology, with diagnostic speed exceeding, and accuracy paralleling, medical experts. While diagnostic confidence never reaches 100%, combining machines plus physicians reliably enhances system performance. Cognitive programs are impacting medical practice by applying natural language processing to read the rapidly expanding scientific literature and collate years of diverse electronic medical records. In this and other ways, AI may optimize the care trajectory of chronic disease patients, suggest precision therapies for complex illnesses, reduce medical errors, and improve subject enrollment into clinical trials.

"Platelet-Rich Plasma: A Review of Biology and Applications in Plastic Surgery","Learning Objectives: After studying this article, the reader should be able to: 1. Define the role of platelets in hemostasis and wound healing. 2. Describe the technologies for platelet concentration and application. 3. Characterize the platelet concentration and growth factor components of platelet-rich plasma. 4. List the potential applications of platelet-rich plasma in plastic surgery and how it may be applied intraoperatively. 5. Discuss the limitations of the use of platelet-rich plasma and its potential complications. Summary: Healing of hard and soft tissue is mediated by a complex array of intracellular and extracellular events that are regulated by signaling proteins, a process that is, at present, incompletely understood. What is certain, however, is that platelets play a prominent if not deciding role. Controlled animal studies of soft and hard tissues have suggested that the application of autogenous platelet-rich plasma can enhance wound healing. The clinical use of platelet-rich plasma for a wide variety of applications has been reported; however, many reports are anecdotal and few include controls to definitively determine the role of platelet-rich plasma. The authors describe platelet biology and its role in wound healing; the preparation, characterization, and use of platelet-rich plasma; and those applications in plastic surgery for which it may be useful.

"Periodontal plastic surgery for treatment of localized gingival recessions: a systematic review","Background: The evidence for the efficacy of periodontal plastic surgery (PPS) in the treatment of recession defects has not yet been systematically evaluated. The objective of this review was to systematically review the efficacy of PPS in achieving root coverage in the treatment of localized gingival recession. The following surgical procedures have been considered in this review: guided tissue regeneration (GTR), free gingival graft (FGG), connective tissue graft (CTG), and coronally advanced flap (CAF). Methods: Randomized and controlled trials, as well as case series of at least 6 months' follow-up, were searched. Data sources included electronic databases and hand-searched journals. Screening, data abstraction and quality assessment were conducted independently and in duplicate. Results: Regarding recession reduction, a limited but statistically significant greater benefit was found for CTG compared with GTR (weighted mean difference: 0.43 mm, 95% CI: 0.62-0.23). No differences were found comparing either GTR with CAF or resorbable versus non-resorbable GTR barriers. Gain in attachment was also similar for each of the three comparisons. Analysis of single arms of trials and case series demonstrated that PPS can have a marked improvement on clinical parameters but heterogeneity was often high and only partly explained by initial defect depth. Conclusions: Overall, PPS was effective in reducing gingival recessions with a concomitant improvement in attachment levels. Even though no single treatment can be considered superior to all the others, CTG was statistically significantly more effective than GTR in recession reduction. Further research is needed to identify the factors most associated with successful outcomes.","Roccuzzo, M; Bunino, M; Needleman, I; Sanz, M",2002,"JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PERIODONTOLOGY"

"Outcomes research in facial plastic surgery: A review and new directions","Outcomes research is a fast-growing field of study that focuses on patient-related aspects of medical or surgical outcomes such as satisfaction and quality of life. Tn the realm of facial plastic surgery, many outcomes are subjective evaluations based on the patient and physician's judgment as to the surgical result, but little has been done to quantify these qualitative results in an objective manner. This paper discusses the basis for outcomes research and suggests its application to the field of facial plastic surgery. Four new facial plastic outcomes instruments have been developed and are provided for the potential use in measuring the quality of life results of rhytidectomy, rhinoplasty, blepharoplasty, and skin rejuvenation procedures.","Alsarraf, R",2000,"AESTHETIC PLASTIC SURGERY"
"Efficacy of periodontal plastic surgery procedures in the treatment of localized facial gingival recessions. A systematic review","BackgroundThe aim of this Systematic Review (SR) was to assess the clinical efficacy of periodontal plastic surgery procedures in the treatment of localized gingival recessions (Rec) with or without inter-dental clinical attachment loss (iCAL). Material and MethodsElectronic and hand searches were performed to identify randomized clinical trials (RCTs) on treatment of single gingival recessions with at least 6months of follow-up. Primary outcome variable was complete root coverage (CRC). Secondary outcome variables were recession reduction (RecRed) and keratinized tissue (KT) gain. To evaluate treatment effect, Odds Ratios were combined for dichotomous data and mean differences in continuous data using a random-effect model. ResultsFifty-one RCTs (53 articles) with a total of 1574 treated patients (1744 recessions) were included in this SR. Finally, 30 groups of comparisons were identified and a total of 80 meta-analyses were performed. Coronally Advanced Flap (CAF) was associated with higher probability of CRC and higher amount of RecRed than Semilunar Coronal Positioned Flap (SCPF). The combination CAF plus Connective Tissue Graft (CAF+CTG) or CAF plus Enamel Matrix Derivative (CAF+EMD) was more effective than CAF alone in terms of CRC and RecRed. The combination CAF plus Collagen Matrix (CAF+CM) achieved higher RecRed than CAF alone. In addition, CAF+CTG achieved CRC more frequently than CAF+EMD, SCPF, Free Gingival Graft (FGG) and Laterally Positioned Flap (LPS). CAF+CTG was also associated with higher RecRed than Barrier Membranes (CAF+GTR), CAF+EMD and CAF+CM. GTR was not able to improve the clinical efficacy of CAF. Studies adding Acellular Dermal Matrix (ADM) under CAF showed a large heterogeneity and not significant benefits compared with CAF alone. Multiple combinations, using more than a single graft/biomaterial under the flap, usually provide similar or less benefits than simpler, control procedures in term of root coverage outcomes. ConclusionsCAF procedures alone or with CTG, EMD are supported by large evidence in modern periodontal plastic surgery. CAF+CTG achieved the best clinical outcomes in single gingival recessions with or without iCAL.","Cairo, F; Nieri, M; Pagliaro, U",2014,"JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PERIODONTOLOGY"

"Use of octyl-2-cyanoacrylate for skin closure in facial plastic surgery","Octyl-2-cyanoacrylate is a long carbon chain cyanoacrylate derivative that is stronger and more pliable than its shorter chain derivatives. One hundred and eleven patients underwent elective surgical procedures by the same surgeon using either octyl-2-cyanoacrylate or sutures for skin closure at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Most patients underwent excision of benign skin lesions with a mean wound size of 112 mm(3). Patients were randomized into either control (vertical mattress suture closure) or test groups (closure with octyl-2-cyanoacrylate). Surgical judgment was used to determine which wounds in each group required application of subcutaneous sutures to relieve tension and aid in skin edge eversion. Generally, full-thickness (through dermis) wounds larger than 1 cm(3) required the use of subcutaneous sutures. The time required to close the epidermis with suture (mean, 3 minutes and 47 seconds) was about four times that of octyl-2-cyanoacrylate (mean, 55 seconds). Wounds were evaluated at 5 to 7 days for infection, wound dehiscence, or tissue reaction, and at 90 days using the modified Hollander wound evaluation scale. At 1 year, photographs of the wounds were evaluated by two facial plastic surgeons that graded the cosmetic outcome using a previously validated visual analog scale. There were no instances of wound dehiscence, hematoma, or infection ill either group. Results of wound evaluation at 90 days determined by the modified Hollander scale revealed equivalent cosmetic results in both groups. Results of the visual analog scale ratings showed scores of 21.7 +/- 16.3 for the 49 patients treated with octyl-2-cyanoacrylate and 29.2 +/- 17.7 for the 51 control patients treated with sutures. The lower visual analog scale score represented a superior cosmetic outcome at 1 year with the octyl-2-cyanoacrylate as compared with sutures. This difference is statistically significant at p = 0.03. Additionally, patient satisfaction was very high in the group treated with octyl-2-cyanoacrylate.","Toriumi, DM; O'Grady, K; Desai, D; Bagal, A",1998,"PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY"
"Clearing the smoke: The scientific rationale for tobacco abstention with plastic surgery","The use of tobacco is a significant contributor to preventable morbidity and mortality in the United States. A significant proportion of cardiovascular diseases, various oral and pulmonary neoplasms, nonmalignant respiratory diseases, and peripheral vascular disorders can be attributed to the use of cigarettes. Surgical outcomes can also be adversely affected as a result of cigarette smoking with intraoperative and postoperative pulmonary, cardiovascular, and cerebrovascular complications as well as increased wound healing complications. These are found across the entire spectrum of surgical specialties. Tissue ischemia and wound-healing impairment secondary to the influence of tobacco is particularly problematic for the plastic surgeon, especially during elective facial aesthetic procedures, cosmetic and reconstructive breast operations, abdominoplasty, free-tissue transfer, and replantation procedures. By educating and providing guidelines to those patients who smoke and by refusing to operate on individuals who fail to abstain, tobacco-associated surgical morbidity in the plastic and reconstructive surgery patient can be eliminated.","Krueger, JK; Rohrich, RJ",2001,"PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY"
"Application of Platelet-Rich Plasma in Plastic Surgery: Clinical and In Vitro Evaluation","The clinical use of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) for a wide variety of application has been reportedly employed most prevalently in problematic wounds, maxillofacial and hemi-facial atrophy, Romberg Syndrome, and diabetic foot ulcers. To our knowledge, PRP has never been described in the enhancement of fat grafting during tissue-engineering application in vivo. The authors describe the preparation of PRP and its use in a series of 43 patients who underwent plastic, reconstructive, and maxillofacial surgery for chronic lower extremity ulcers (n = 18) and multiple facial applications (n = 25). PRP mixed with fat grafting was used in 76% patients affected by multiple facial diseases and in 88.9% patients affected by lower extremity ulcers. PRP injection alone was used in the remaining patients. The authors observed that after a 7.1-week and 9.7-week (average) course of twice-daily wound treatment with PRP suspended on a collagen base, 61.1% and 88.9% of chronic lower extremity ulcers underwent to 100% reepithelization compared with 40% and 60% of controls (n = 10) treated with hyaluronic acid and collagen medication. In patients treated with reconstructing three-dimensional projection of face by fat grafting and PRP, we observed a 70% maintenance of contour restoring and three-dimensional volume after 1 year compared to only 31% of controls (n - 10) treated with fat grafting alone. In vitro, PRP induced a significant increase in the number of adipose-tissue-derived stem cells compared to control cultures. These results documented that PRP accelerates chronic skin ulcer reepithelization and improves maintenance and function of fat graft in patients who underwent plastic reconstructive surgery, possibly by stimulating adipose-tissue-derived stem cell proliferation.","Cervelli, V; Gentile, P; Scioli, MG; Grimaldi, M; Casciani, CU; Spagnoli, LG; Orlandi, A",2009,"TISSUE ENGINEERING PART C-METHODS"
"Emerging applications of bedside 3D printing in plastic surgery","Modern imaging techniques are an essential component of preoperative planning in plastic and reconstructive surgery. However, conventional modalities, including three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions, are limited by their representation on 2D workstations. 3D printing, also known as rapid prototyping or additive manufacturing, was once the province of industry to fabricate models from a computer-aided design (CAD) in a layer-by-layer manner. The early adopters in clinical practice have embraced the medical imaging-guided 3D-printed biomodels for their ability to provide tactile feedback and a superior appreciation of visuospatial relationship between anatomical structures. With increasing accessibility, investigators are able to convert standard imaging data into a CAD file using various 3D reconstruction softwares and ultimately fabricate 3D models using 3D printing techniques, such as stereolithography, multijet modeling, selective laser sintering, binder jet technique, and fused deposition modeling. However, many clinicians have questioned whether the cost-to-benefit ratio justifies its ongoing use. The cost and size of 3D printers have rapidly decreased over the past decade in parallel with the expiration of key 3D printing patents. Significant improvements in clinical imaging and user-friendly 3D software have permitted computer-aided 3D modeling of anatomical structures and implants without outsourcing in many cases. These developments offer immense potential for the application of 3D printing at the bedside for a variety of clinical applications. In this review, existing uses of 3D printing in plastic surgery practice spanning the spectrum from templates for facial transplantation surgery through to the formation of bespoke craniofacial implants to optimize post-operative esthetics are described. Furthermore, we discuss the potential of 3D printing to become an essential office based tool in plastic surgery to assist in preoperative planning, developing intraoperative guidance tools, teaching patients and surgical trainees, and producing patient-specific prosthetics in everyday surgical practice.","Chae, MP; Rozeni, WM; McMenamin, PG; Findlay, MW; Spychal, RT; Hunter-Smith, DJ",2015,"FRONTIERS IN SURGERY"

"A Large Multicenter Outcome Study of Female Genital Plastic Surgery","Introduction. Female Genital Plastic Surgery, a relatively new entry in the field of Cosmetic and Plastic Surgery, has promised sexual enhancement and functional and cosmetic improvement for women. Are the vulvovaginal aesthetic procedures of Labiaplasty, Vaginoplasty/Perineoplasty (""Vaginal Rejuvenation"") and Clitoral Hood Reduction effective, and do they deliver on that promise? For what reason do women seek these procedures? What complications are evident, and what effects are noted regarding sexual function for women and their partners? Who should be performing these procedures, what training should they have, and what are the ethical considerations? Aim. This study was designed to produce objective, utilizable outcome data regarding FGPS. Main Outcome Measures. 1) Reasons for considering surgery from both patient's and physician's perspective; 2) Pre-operative sexual functioning per procedure; 3) Overall patient satisfaction per procedure; 4) Effect of procedure on patient's sexual enjoyment, per procedure; 5) Patient's perception of effect on her partner's sexual enjoyment, per procedure; 6) Complications. Methods. This cross-sectional study, including 258 women and encompassing 341 separate procedures, comes from a group of twelve gynecologists, gynecologic urologists and plastic surgeons from ten centers in eight states nationwide. 104 labiaplasties, 24 clitoral hood reductions, 49 combined labiaplasty/clitoral hood reductions, 47 vaginoplasties and/or perineoplasties, and 34 combined labiaplasty and/or reduction of the clitoral hood plus vaginoplasty/perineoplasty procedures were studied retrospectively, analyzing both patient's and physician's perception of surgical rationale, pre-operative sexual function and several outcome criteria. Results. Combining the three groups, 91.6% of patients were satisfied with the results of their surgery after a 6-42 month follow-up. Significant subjective enhancement in sexual functioning for both women and their sexual partners was noted (p = 0.0078), especially in patients undergoing vaginal tightening/perineal support procedures. Complications were acceptable and not of major consequence. Conclusions. While emphasizing that these female genital plastic procedures are not performed to correct ""abnormalities,"" as there is a wide range of normality in the external and internal female genitalia, both parous and nulliparous, many women chose to modify their vulvas and vaginas. From the results of this large study pooling data from a diverse group of experienced genital plastic surgeons, outcome in both general and sexual satisfaction appear excellent.

"Plastic Surgery Classics: Characteristics of 50 Top-Cited Articles in Four Plastic Surgery Journals since 1946","Background: Citation of published articles by peers provides an indication of the relevance of the scientific work. Still, it is unknown what kinds of plastic surgery articles are cited most often. The authors set out to identify the characteristics of the 50 top-cited articles as published in four international, peerreviewed, PubMed-indexed general plastic surgery journals. Methods: The 50 most-cited articles were identified in each of the following journals: Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, the British Journal of Plastic Surgery, the Annals of Plastic Surgery, and the Scandinavian Journal of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery and Hand Surgery. These 200 articles were ranked after their citation index, defined as the mean number of times they were cited per year during the first 16 years after publication. The top-50 articles thus ranked were analyzed for citation and journal distribution, geographic and institutional origin, surgical and anatomical subject, and level of evidence. Results: Forty-one of the 50 top-cited articles (82 percent) were published in Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery and 35 articles (70 percent) originated from institutions within the United States. Most of the articles dealt with the reconstruction of acquired defects (45 percent) and with basic or experimental research (41 percent). Research that offered means for clinical improvement, rather than a high level of evidence or the results of multi-institutional collaboration, was most often cited.

"Postoperative Enoxaparin Prevents Symptomatic Venous Thromboembolism in High-Risk Plastic Surgery Patients","Background: Venous thromboembolism is a major patient safety issue. The Plastic Surgery Foundation-sponsored Venous Thromboembolism Prevention Study examined whether postoperative enoxaparin prevents symptomatic venous thromboembolism in adult plastic surgery patients. Methods: In 2009, four sites uniformly adopted a clinical protocol. Patients with a Caprini score of 3 or higher received postoperative enoxaparin prophylaxis for the duration of inpatient stay. Venous Thromboembolism Prevention Study historical control patients had an operation between 2006 and 2008 but received no chemoprophylaxis for 60 days after surgery. The primary study outcome was symptomatic 60-day venous thromboembolism. Results: Three thousand three hundred thirty-four patients (1876 controls and 1458 enoxaparin patients) were included. Notable risk reduction was present in patients with a Caprini score greater than 8 (8.54 percent versus 4.07 percent; p = 0.182) and a Caprini score of 7 to 8 (2.55 percent versus 1.15 percent; p = 0.230) who received postoperative enoxaparin. Logistic regression was limited to highest risk patients (Caprini score >= 7) and demonstrated that length of stay greater than or equal to 4 days (adjusted odds ratio, 4.63; p = 0.007) and Caprini score greater than 8 (odds ratio, 2.71; p = 0.027) were independent predictors of venous thromboembolism. When controlling for length of stay and Caprini score, receipt of postoperative enoxaparin was protective against venous thromboembolism (odds ratio, 0.39; p = 0.042). Conclusions: In high-risk plastic surgery patients, postoperative enoxaparin prophylaxis is protective against 60-day venous thromboembolism when controlling for baseline risk and length of stay. Hospitalization for 4 or more days is an independent risk factor for venous thromboembolism. (Plast. Reconstr.

"Measuring outcomes in plastic surgery: Body image and quality of life in abdominoplasty patients","Abdominoplasty is an increasingly common aesthetic surgery procedure that has yet to be evaluated using the most recently developed and psychometrically sophisticated measures of body image and quality-of-life outcomes. This study prospectively evaluated 30 consecutive female abdominoplasty patients, preoperatively and postoperatively, using measures of body image, psychological investment in appearance, and general psychosocial functioning. One-way repeated-measures (pretest versus post-test) analyses of variance revealed significant positive post-surgical changes on the Appearance Evaluation subscale of the Multidimensional Body-Self Relations Questionnaire. Mean scores for the questionnaire's Body Areas Satisfaction Scale improved postoperatively (p < 0.001). Scores for the Body Exposure and Sexual Relations Questionnaire also improved significantly (p < 0.001) postoperatively. These findings indicate significant improvements in body image outcome, including positive changes in patients' evaluations of their overall appearance, their average body image dissatisfaction, and their experiences of self-consciousness and avoidance of body exposure during sexual activities. As predicted, no changes were seen on any measure of psychological investment in appearance or on patients' reports of general psychosocial functioning (self-esteem, satisfaction with life, or social anxiety).","Bolton, MA; Pruzinsky, T; Cash, TF; Persing, JA",2003,"PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY"
"National plastic surgery survey: Face lift techniques and complications","The purpose of this study was to assess trends in technique and philosophy of face lifting, associated procedures, and the incidence and management of complications. Surveys were sent to 3800 members of the American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons (ASPRS); 570 surveys (15 percent) were returned. Numerous very specific technique and philosophy questions were asked. Details of demographics, techniques, incidence of complications, management of complications, and basic philosophy are presented. Three basic conclusions can be gleaned from this study: (1) Surgeons perform more tried and true methods of aesthetic surgery, rather than the many new methods that seem to get the most attention in the media and at the meetings. (2) It seems that less-experienced surgeons tend to be generally more conservative in their approach to aesthetic surgery. (3) Complication rates reported by the plastic surgery community at large coincide with previous complication rates, as outlined in other nonsurvey studies.

Procedures that have been noted to be adversely affected by cigarette smoking include rhytidectomy, abdominoplasty, breast reconstruction, free-tissue transfer, and digital replantation.

Data extraction: Data from retrieved studies were reviewed and tabulated according to year of publication, study design, human or animal studies, characteristics of the population, mode of application, outcomes and preparation method. Data synthesis: A total of 15 randomised controlled trials and 25 case-control studies were found. Thirty-six publications demonstrated favourable outcomes with the use of platelet-rich plasma. The included articles were divided into three topics related to plastic surgery: wound healing, fat grafting and bone grafting. Conclusions: This systematic review describes a substantially beneficial effect of platelet-rich plasma for several indications, including a better wound healing rate, an increased survival rate of fat grafts and an enhancement of bone graft regeneration.

"A Plastic Surgery Application in Evolution: Three-Dimensional Printing","Background: Three-dimensional printing represents an evolving technology still in its infancy. Currently, individuals and small business entities have the ability to manufacture physical objects from digital renderings, computer-aided design, and open source files. Design modifications and improvements in extrusion methods have made this technology much more affordable. This article explores the potential uses of three-dimensional printing in plastic surgery. Methods: A review was performed detailing the known uses of three-dimensional printing in medicine. The potential applications of three-dimensional printing in plastic surgery are discussed. Results: Various applications for three-dimensional printing technology have emerged in medicine, including printing organs, printing body parts, bio-printing, and computer-aided tissue engineering. In plastic surgery, these tools offer various prospective applications for surgical planning, resident education, and the development of custom prosthetics. Conclusions: Numerous applications exist in medicine, including the printing of devices, implants, tissue replacements, and even whole organs. Plastic surgeons may likely find this technology indispensable in surgical planning, education, and prosthetic device design and development in the near future.","Gerstle, TL; Ibrahim, AMS; Kim, PS; Lee, BT; Lin, SJ",2014,"PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY"
"Evidence-Based Periodontal Plastic Surgery. II. An Individual Data Meta-Analysis for Evaluating Factors in Achieving Complete Root Coverage","Background: The aim of this review is to conduct an individual patient data meta-analysis of randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) to evaluate whether baseline recession-, patient-, and procedure-related factors can influence the achievement of complete root coverage (CRC). Methods: A literature search with no restrictions regarding status or the language of publication was performed for MEDLINE (for Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online), EMBASE (for Excerpta Medica Database), CENTRAL (for Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials), and the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Specialized Register databases up to and including March 2011. Only RCTs, with a duration of >= 6 months evaluating recession areas (Miller Class I or II) that were treated by means of root coverage procedures were included. Mixed-effects logistic regression analyses were conducted to evaluate associations between five baseline variables and CRC. Results: Of the 70 potentially eligible trials, 22 were included in the meta-analyses. In total, the data from 320 patients and 16 procedures were evaluated. None of the RCTs were classified as low risk of bias. Of the 602 recessions treated, 310 (51.5%) achieved CRC. Subepithelial connective tissue grafts (SCTGs), matrix grafts, and enamel matrix derivative protein (EMD) procedures were superior in achieving CRC when compared to coronally advanced flap (CAF) alone. For the adjusted covariates, the greater the baseline recession depth, the smaller the chance of achieving CRC (individual procedure analysis [odds ratio (OR) = 0.55; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.44, 0.70] and grouped procedure analysis [OR = 0.56; 95% CI = 0.45, 0.71]), as well as studies with conflict of interest were more likely to achieve CRC than those without conflict of interest (individual procedure analysis [OR = 6.78; 95% CI = 1.78, 25.86]). Conclusions: SCTGs, matrix grafts, and EMD were superior to CAF in achieving CRC, but SCTGs showed the best predictability. The impossibility of inclusion of all identified RCTs should be taken into consideration when interpreting the present findings.

"A reconstructive algorithm for plastic surgery following extensive chest wall resection","Chest wall reconstruction following extensive resection is greatly facilitated by the use of vascularised flaps and prosthetic material. Plastic surgeons are often asked to assist with coverage of large chest watt defects. However, in addition to soft tissue coverage, we need to address other important issues such as the status of the pleural cavity, and the requirement for skeletal support. The purpose of this report is to analyse our experience, provide a reconstructive algorithm following the ablative procedure and review the literature. Two hundred chest wall resections were performed from 1975 to 2000. Defect location was divided into anterior (n = 73), lateral (n = 36), anterior-lateral (n = 36), posterior-lateral (n = 19), posterior (n = 22) and forequarter (n = 14). Average number of ribs resected was four. One hundred and fifty-eight patients (79%) required chest wall reconstruction with either prosthetic material and/or flap closure. Mesh closure was required in 85 cases (43%), being highest for lateral defects (61%), and Lowest for anterior defects (31%). Vascularised flaps were needed in 112 patients (56%), more common in anterior defects (79%), and less common for the posterior-lateral defects (26%). Inpatient complication rate was 27% (43/158) following reconstruction, with a mortality of 6% (10/158). Chest wall reconstruction is common following extensive resection. This includes management of the pleural cavity, skeletal support and soft tissue coverage. A better understanding of the respiratory mechanics and local thoracoabdominal anatomy is crucial for managing these complex defects. The need for skeletal support was more prevalent in lateral and posterior-lateral defects. Flap reconstruction was required more often to cover large anterior defects, with regional flaps predominating. (C) 2004 The British Association of Plastic Surgeons. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

"Patient-Reported Outcome Measures in Plastic Surgery: Use and Interpretation in Evidence-Based Medicine","Understanding patients' perceptions of surgical results and their impacts on quality of life is of primary importance in plastic surgery, as procedures are largely performed to improve either appearance or function. Patient-reported outcome measures are questionnaires specifically designed to quantify aspects of health-related quality of life from the patient's perspective. This article presents an overview of patient-reported outcome measures. It also aims to provide plastic surgeons with the necessary critical appraisal skills to interpret and apply evidence from patient-reported outcomes research in their own clinical practice. (Plast.

"Abdominoplasty and abdominal contour surgery: A national plastic surgery survey","Background: According to the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery's 2004 Cosmetic Surgery National Data Bank, during the last 7 years, the number of abdominoplasty procedures performed has increased 344 percent. A national report on abdominoplasty has not been since 1977. Grazer and Goldwyn's study reflects the preliposuction era of abdominal contouring surgery. The purpose of this study was to assess current trends in abdominal contouring techniques and associated procedures and the incidence of their complications. Methods: The study was designed as a descriptive correlation survey evaluating the frequency of various abdominal contour techniques and complications among 3300 randomly chosen members of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. There were 497 respondents, for a response rate of 15 percent. Results: A total of 20,029 procedures were reported in the survey; 35 percent (n = 7010) were liposuction of the abdomen, 10 percent (n = 2003) were limited abdominoplasties, and 55 percent (n = 11,016) were full abdominoplasties. Survey data covered the plastic surgeon's demographics, techniques, and incidence of complications during a 12-month period. Conclusions: The authors report the largest series of local and systemic complication rates and compare them with those of previously published abdominoplasty surveys. With respect to full abdominoplasty, lower complication rates for deep vein thrombosis (0.04 percent) and pulmonary embolus (0.02 percent) were seen. No deaths were reported. There was no correlation between a surgeon's years in practice and complication rates, in concordance with the earlier study by Grazer and Goldwyn. Despite more extensive abdominal contouring techniques and the addition of liposuction to abdominal contouring, the local and systemic complication rates coincided with previous complication rates, as outlined in other studies.","Matarasso, A; Swift, RW; Rankin, M",2006,"PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY"
"Saline-filled breast implants: A plastic surgery educational foundation multicenter outcomes study","In 1993, the Plastic Surgery Educational Foundation commissioned the senior author (Cunningham) to design an 11-center retrospective cohort outcomes study to obtain physician-and patient-reported data on saline-filled breast implants. Data were obtained from 504 patients with 995 saline-filled breast implants placed between January 1, 1980 and December 31, 1989, with a mean follow-up of 6 years. Most (93.8 percent) saline-filled breast implants were placed for breast augmentation. Of the 504 patient, 104 (20.6 pet-cent) required reoperation for open capsulotomy or for replacement or removal of a deflated implant. Complications occurred in 22 patients (4.4 percent), with hematoma being most common. Implant deflation occurred in 55 implants (5.5 percent) and affected 51 patients (10.1 percent) but was underreported by chart abstraction alone. Risk factors for implant deflation included underfilling the implant by more than 25 cc (odds ratio 3.3, p = 0.0400), the use of model 1800 saline-filled breast implants (odds ratio 3.1, p = 0.0010), intraluminal antibiotics (odds ratio 2.6, p = 0.0183), and intraluminal steroids (odds ratio 2.4, p = 0.0711). Based on 44 of 55 saline-filled breast implants with known deflation dates, actuarial survival is 95.7 to 98.0 percent at 5 years and 90.2 to 95.2 percent at 10 years (95 percent confidence interval). Significant periprosthetic capsular contracture affected 103 patients (20.4 per-cent) during follow-up. Risk factors for capsular-contracture included omitting intraluminal antibiotics (odds ratio 16.7, p = 0.0001), omitting intraluminal steroids (odds ratio 12.5, p = 0.0001), submammary placement of the saline-filled breast implant (odds ratio 7.8, p = 0.0001), and use of antibiotics in the implant pocket (odds ratio 6.1, p = 0.0001). Overall patient satisfaction with saline-filled breast implants was rated as high by 94.2 percent, and 94.8 percent of patients would choose saline-filled breast implants again. Dissatisfaction with their saline-filled breast implants was more frequent in patients with significant breast firmness (odds ratio 22.9, p = 0.0001), those undergoing prophylactic mastectomy (odds ratio 8.2, p = 0.0005), and those desiring smaller implants (odds ratio 6.9, p = 0.0001). In conclusion, saline-filled breast implants are a safe alternative to silicone gel-filled breast implants and demonstrate a high rate of patient satisfaction. Underfilling of saline-filled breast implants should be avoided because it contributes to deflation. Although intraluminal antibiotics and steroids protect against capsular contracture, they also contribute to saline-filled breast implant deflation. The incidence of capsular contracture is decreased by placing the saline-filled breast implant in the subpectoral position. Finally, patients should be aware of the possible need for reoperations related to their implants.","Gutowski, KA; Mesna, GT; Cunningham, BL",1997,"PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY"

"Benchmarking Outcomes in Plastic Surgery: National Complication Rates for Abdominoplasty and Breast Augmentation","Background: The authors evaluated the use of national databases to track surgical complications among abdominoplasty and breast augmentation patients. Methods: Their study population included all patients with abdominoplasty or breast augmentation in the Tracking Operations and Outcomes for Plastic Surgeons (TOPS) and CosmetAssure databases from 2003 to 2007. They evaluated the incidence of hematoma, infection, and/ or deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary embolism. Chi-square and t tests were used for the analyses. Results: The TOPS and CosmetAssure databases included 7310 and 3350 patients with abdominoplasty and 30,831 and 14,227 patients with breast augmentation, respectively. In the TOPS and CosmetAssure populations, the complication rates for abdominoplasty were 0.9 percent and 0.5 percent with hematoma (p = 0.29), 3.5 percent and 0.7 percent with infection (p < 0.001), and 0.3 percent and 0.1 percent with deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary embolism (p = 0.05), respectively. The complication rates for breast augmentation in TOPS and CosmetAssure were 0.6 percent and 0.7 percent with hematoma (p = 0.21), 0.3 percent and 0.1 percent with infection (p < 0.001), and 0.02 percent and less than 0.01 percent with deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary embolism (p = 0.31), respectively. Conclusions: Complication rates for abdominoplasty and breast augmentation were similar in TOPS and CosmetAssure, providing a measure of cross-validation. The low complication rates support the safety of these procedures when they are performed by plastic surgeons. These data should be used by individual practitioners for outcomes benchmarking. (Plast.

At 3 months and again at 6 months after surgery, these same patients were sent postal follow-up packs containing the SF-36 and Rosenberg questionnaires and postoperative condition-specific questions requesting information on complications, relief of physical symptoms, scarring, pain and opinion of the aesthetic result. The response rate was 82% (90 patients) at 3 months and 76% (84 patients) at 6 months.

"Clinical efficacy of periodontal plastic surgery procedures: Consensus Report of Group 2 of the 10th European Workshop on Periodontology","AimThe scope of the discussions of this consensus report was to assess the strength of the scientific evidence and make clinical and research recommendations for surgical interventions to cover exposed root surfaces and enhance soft tissues at implants. MethodsDiscussions were informed by three systematic reviews covering single recessions, multiple recessions and soft-tissue deficiencies at implants. The strength of the evidence was assessed using a modification in GRADE. The group also emphasized the need to report the experience of the surgeon and the performance of the control intervention (CONSORT guidelines for non-pharmacological treatment). ResultsA moderate strength of evidence supported the following statements for single (moderately deep, mostly maxillary) recessions without inter-dental attachment loss: (i) The addition of a connective tissue graft (CTG) improved outcomes of coronally advanced flaps (CAF). (ii) The addition of enamel matrix derivative (EMD) improved the outcomes of CAF. For multiple recessions, preliminary data indicate that flaps specifically designed to treat this condition are worthy of additional attention. Emerging data indicate that it is possible to obtain complete root coverage at sites with some inter-dental attachment loss. With regards to soft-tissue deficiencies at implants, several procedures are available, but great heterogeneity among studies does not allow drawing conclusions at this time. ConclusionsThe group highlighted that periodontal plastic procedures are complex, technique-sensitive interventions that require advanced skills and expertise. At single recessions, the addition of autologous CTG or EMD under CAF improves complete root coverage and may be considered the procedure of choice at maxillary anterior and premolar teeth. The adjunctive benefit needs to be put in the context of increased morbidity of the donor area or increased cost. Additional research is needed to: (i) assess the role of alternatives to autologous soft-tissue grafting in combination with CAF; (ii) identify the optimal surgical design and the need for additional soft-tissue grafting (or alternatives) at multiple recessions, recessions with inter-dental attachment loss and soft-tissue deficiencies at implants.","Tonetti, MS; Jepsen, S",2014,"JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PERIODONTOLOGY"
"Cytokines, growth factors, and plastic surgery","Numerous inflammatory cytokines and growth factors have been identified and are known to be essential for normal wound healing and host defense, and many have been implicated in disease states treated by plastic surgeons. Cytokines and growth factors are members of a large functional group of polypeptide regulatory molecules secreted by different cell lines. These peptides exert their influence through autocrine and paracrine fashions within sites of injury and repair. Although cytokines and growth factors are crucial in initiating, sustaining, and regulating the postinjury response, these same molecules have been implicated in impaired wound healing, abnormal scarring, and chronic cutaneous diseases. Therapeutic manipulation of inflammatory mediators in normal and impaired wounds has been performed, with mixed clinical results, but evolving strategies such as gene therapy, as well as further characterization of the cellular-mechanism cytokines and growth-factor triggers, will further add to our therapeutic options. This article discusses the current understanding of important cytokines and growth factors involved in the normal injury response and then addresses pathological states associated with an inappropriate expression of these mediators. Finally, a summary of various cytokine and growth factor-directed strategies being used in impaired wound healing states is presented.","Rumalla, VK; Borah, GL",2001,"PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY"
"HYPERBARIC-OXYGEN THERAPY IN PLASTIC-SURGERY - A REVIEW ARTICLE","The most important effects of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO), for the surgeon, are the stimulation of leukocyte microbial killing, the enhancement of fibroblast replication, and increased collagen formation and neovascularization of ischemic tissue. Preoperative hyperbaric oxygen induces neovascularization in tissue with radionecrosis. Refractory osteomyelitis and necrotizing fasciitis appear to respond to adjunctive hyperbaric oxygen. Crush injury and compartment syndrome appear to benefit through preservation of ATP in cell membranes, which limits edema. Hyperbaric oxygen in burn injury permits shorter hospital stays, a reduced number of surgeries, and less fluid replacement. Skin grafts and flaps are reported to take more completely and more rapidly. The same mechanisms may apply in ischemic problem wounds such as infected diabetic extremities. Contraindications and side effects are described. Hyperbaric oxygen will not heal normal wounds more rapidly but may, under certain circumstances, induce problem wounds to heal more like normal ones.","KINDWALL, EP; GOTTLIEB, LJ; LARSON, DL",1991,"PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY"
"Photographic standards in plastic surgery","Standard photographic technique in plastic surgery is an important topic that has been stressed in the discipline over the past several years. Clinical photographs should always be taken with the same camera lens, lens setting, lighting, film, and patient position to ensure reproducibility and to enable valid pre- and postoperative comparisons. A 35-mm single lens reflex camera is highly recommended for this type of photography Two lenses are suggested, one with a focal length range of 50 to 60 mm and one with a focal length range of 90 to 105 mm. Both should have macro capability. Two or more flash units are recommended, either camera-mounted or a studio system set-up in the office. Using the patient preparation method and technique outlined in the text, the Standards in Clinical Photography achieve consistency from patient to patient and also in the same patient in pre- and postoperative photographs. Henceforth, the information discussed in the article forms the basis for standard views, regardless of the image-capture medium.","DiBernardo, BE; Adams, RL; Krause, J; Fiorillo, MA; Gheradini, G",1998,"PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY"
"Results of 268 pressure sores in 158 patients managed jointly by plastic surgery and rehabilitation medicine","Despite improvements in surgical repair of pressure sores, recurrence rates greater than 80 percent are reported, thus indicating that this difficult problem is not yet solved. Recurrence results in additional hospitalizations and increased medical expenses. Because associated general clinical and social issues are numerous for these patients, our physical medicine and rehabilitation colleagues are active participants in their perioperative medical care. In addition, the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation also directs a complete postreconstruction rehabilitation and education program for them. The results of surgically repaired pressure sores for patients managed in this collaborative fashion have not been previously reported. Pressure sore patients at the Harborview and University of Washington Medical Centers are evaluated by plastic surgery colleagues together with the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation. Patients believed to be candidates for complete postoperative rehabilitation are offered surgical repair and constitute this study cohort. Individuals who cannot cooperate with our protocol are treated nonoperatively and are not included in this study. A retrospective analysis of all 158 patients (mean age 34.5 years) operated on for 268 grade III and IV pressure sores between October of 1977 and December of 1989 was performed. Following surgical debridement and reconstruction, patients receive their principal medical care from the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation sen,ice while the Plastic Surgery Department manages the surgical wounds. Graduated patient mobilization is initiated in accord with a mutually agreed upon standardized protocol. New or primary sores numbered 174 (65 percent), and recurrent or secondary sores numbered 94 (35 percent). Mean patient follow-up was 3.7 years. The overall pressure sore recurrence rate (recurrence at the same site) was 19 percent, and the overall patient recurrence rate (previous patient developing a new sore) was 25 percent. Recurrence rates of 22 and 15 percent were noted for primary and secondary pressure sores, respectively. On most recent examination, 131 patients (83 percent) had intact pelvic and perineal skin. These results support a collaborative approach to the management of high-grade pressure sore patients. Our protocol of mutual patient evaluation followed by surgical reconstruction and postoperative rehabilitation yields notably low recurrence rates of both primary and secondary sores. In addition, the high percentage of patients who manifest long-term maintenance of skin integrity demonstrates the excellent education in personal skin and self-care that this approach provides. Not only do patients enjoy successful and durable reconstructive results, but additional hospitalizations and health care expenses implicit to pressure sore recurrence are consequently di minished. This collaborative clinical effort remains our standard of care.","Kierney, PC; Engrav, LH; Isik, FF; Esselman, PC; Cardenas, DD; Rand, RP",1998,"PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY"

"Periodontal plastic surgery","The aim of the present article is to summarize current knowledge in terms of the etiology, diagnosis, prognosis and surgical treatment of gingival recession. Whilst the main etiological factors (i.e. toothbrushing trauma and bacterial plaque) are well established, challenges still remain to be solved in the diagnostic, prognostic and classification processes of gingival recession, especially when the main reference parameter - the cemento-enamel junction - is no longer detectable on the affected tooth or when there is a slight loss of periodontal interdental attachment. Root coverage in single type gingival recession defects is a very predictable outcome following the use of various surgical techniques. The coronally advanced flap, with or without connective tissue grafting, is the technique of choice. The adjunctive use of connective tissue grafts improves the probability of achieving complete root coverage. Surgical coverage of multiple gingival recessions is also predictable with the coronally advanced flap and the coronally advanced flap plus the connective tissue graft, but no data are available indicating which, and how many, gingival recessions should be treated adjunctively with connective tissue grafting in order to limit patient morbidity and improve the esthetic outcome. None of the allograft materials currently available can be considered as a full substitute for the connective tissue graft, even if some recent results are encouraging. The need for future studies with patient-based outcomes (i.e. esthetics and morbidity) as primary objectives is emphasized in this review.","Zucchelli, G; Mounssif, I",2015,"PERIODONTOLOGY 2000"
"The Application of Indocyanine Green Fluorescence Angiography in Plastic Surgery","In flap reconstruction of complex defects the perfusion of the reconstructive flap is critical to the ultimate success of the reconstruction. This is especially true in perforator-based flaps where it can be difficult to assess the adequacy of perfusion in the operating room. However, the ability to definitively determine the degree of flap perfusion is imperative to clinical decision-making. An emerging technology using near-infrared angiography with indocyanine green (ICG) dye may significantly improve the immediacy and accuracy of the assessment of flap perfusion. This article reviews the current state of ICG angiography and its use in clinical practice in plastic surgery. There are 17 case series, including a total of 386 patients, published in the literature using ICG angiography in various plastic surgical procedures. ICG angiography may aid flap design and assessment in the intraoperative/postoperative settings, reduce complications, and ultimately improve outcomes.","Liu, DZ; Mathes, DW; Zenn, MR; Neligan, PC",2011,"JOURNAL OF RECONSTRUCTIVE MICROSURGERY"

"Social Media Use and Impact on Plastic Surgery Practice","Background: Social media platforms have revolutionized the way human beings communicate, yet there is little evidence describing how the plastic surgery community has adopted social media. In this article, the authors evaluate current trends in social media use by practicing plastic surgeons. Methods: An anonymous survey on the use of social media was distributed to members of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. Prevalent patterns of social media implementation were elucidated. Results: One-half of respondents were regular social media users. Reasons for using social media included the beliefs that incorporation of social media into medical practice is inevitable (56.7 percent), that they are an effective marketing tool (52.1 percent), and that they provide a forum for patient education (49 percent). Surgeons with a primarily aesthetic surgery practice were more likely to use social media. Most respondents (64.6 percent) stated that social media had no effect on their practice, whereas 33.8 percent reported a positive impact and 1.5 percent reported a negative impact. Conclusions: This study depicts current patterns of social media use by plastic surgeons, including motivations driving its implementation and impressions on its impact. Many feel that social media are an effective marketing tool that generates increased exposure and referrals. A small number of surgeons have experienced negative repercussions from social media involvement. Our study reveals the presence of a void. There is a definite interest among those surveyed in developing best practice standards and oversight to ensure ethical use of social media platforms throughout the plastic surgery community. Continuing discussion regarding these matters should be ongoing as our experience with social media in plastic surgery evolves.","Vardanian, AJ; Kusnezov, N; Im, DD; Lee, JC; Jarrahy, R",2013,"PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY"
"Regenerative potential of leucocyte- and platelet-rich fibrin. Part A: intra-bony defects, furcation defects and periodontal plastic surgery. A systematic review and meta-analysis","AimTo analyse the regenerative potential of leucocyte- and platelet-rich fibrin (L-PRF) during periodontal surgery. Materials and MethodsAn electronic and hand search were conducted in three databases. Only randomized clinical trials were selected and no follow-up limitation was applied. Pocket depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL), bone fill, keratinized tissue width (KTW), recession reduction and root coverage (%) were considered as outcome. When possible, meta-analysis was performed. ResultsTwenty-four articles fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Three subgroups were created: intra-bony defects (IBDs), furcation defects and periodontal plastic surgery. Meta-analysis was performed in all the subgroups. Significant PD reduction (1.10.5mm, p<0.001), CAL gain (1.2 +/- 0.6mm, p<0.001) and bone fill (1.7 +/- 0.7mm, p<0.001) were found when comparing L-PRF to open flap debridement (OFD) in IBDs. For furcation defects, significant PD reduction (1.9 +/- 1.5mm, p=0.01), CAL gain (1.3 +/- 0.4mm, p<0.001) and bone fill (1.5 +/- 0.3mm, p<0.001) were reported when comparing L-PRF to OFD. When L-PRF was compared to a connective tissue graft, similar outcomes were recorded for PD reduction (0.2 +/- 0.3mm, p>0.05), CAL gain (0.2 +/- 0.5mm, p>0.05), KTW (0.3 +/- 0.4mm, p>0.05) and recession reduction (0.2 +/- 0.3mm, p>0.05).

"Efficacy and Safety of Venous Thromboembolism Prophylaxis in Highest Risk Plastic Surgery Patients","Background: The purpose of this study was to stratify plastic surgery patients into venous thromboembolism risk categories; identify patients at highest risk for venous thromboembolism; and quantify rates of postoperative all-cause mortality, venous thromboembolism, and hematoma/bleeding on different forms of thromboprophylaxis. Furthermore, this study aimed to determine the compliance and average duration of outpatient chemoprophylaxis. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was carried out on a single plastic surgeon's experience. Venous thromboembolism risk stratification identified patients at highest risk. Records were reviewed for regimen of thromboprophylaxis and for occurrences of all-cause mortality, venous thromboembolism, and hematoma/bleeding. Outpatient compliance and duration of low-molecular-weight heparin chemoprophylaxis was also documented. Results: During the study time period, 173 operations involved 120 patients at highest risk for venous thromboembolism. Among highest risk patients, one (0.8 percent) suffered a pulmonary embolism, eight (6.7 percent) experienced a deep vein thrombosis, and 15 (12.5 percent) endured a hematoma/bleed. Thirteen of 14 outpatients (92.9 percent) were compliant with low-molecular-weight heparin and remained on chemoprophylaxis for an average of 7.4 days. Conclusions: Mechanical prophylaxis plus subcutaneous heparin (unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin) conferred a statistically significant reduction in the rate of venous thromboembolism without a significant increase in bleeding versus mechanical prophylaxis alone. Subgroup analysis of patients placed on mechanical prophylaxis plus low-molecular-weight heparin revealed similar statistically significant findings. Outpatients placed on low-molecular-weight heparin chemoprophylaxis demonstrated excellent compliance and comfort with self-administration. Therefore, the use of mechanical prophylaxis supplemented with low-molecular-weight heparin is strongly recommended as the first-line regimen for thromboprophylaxis in plastic surgery patients at highest risk for venous thromboembolism.

"Safety and efficacy of office-based surgery with monitored anesthesia care/sedation in 4778 consecutive plastic surgery procedures","Office-based surgery has several potential benefits over hospital-based surgery, including cost containment, ease of scheduling, and convenience to both patients and surgeons. Scrutiny of office-based surgery by regulators and state-licensing agencies has increased and must be addressed by improved documentation of safety and efficacy. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of the authors' office-based plastic surgery, a review was undertaken of 3615 consecutive patients undergoing 4778 outpatient plastic surgery procedures under monitored anesthesia care/sedation in a single office. The charts of 3615 consecutive patients who had undergone office-based surgery with monitored anesthesia care/sedation between May of 1995 and May of 2000 were reviewed. In all cases, the anesthesia protocol used included sedation with midazolam, propofol, and a narcotic administered by a board-certified registered nurse anesthetist with local anesthesia provided by the surgeon. Charts were reviewed for patient profile, types of procedures, multiple procedures, duration of anesthesia, American Society of Anesthesiologists class, and complications related to anesthesia. Outcomes measured included death, airway compromise, dyspnea, hypotension, venous thrombosis, pulmonary emboli, protracted nausea and vomiting lasting more than 24 hours, and unplanned hospital admissions. Statistical analyses were performed using the Microsoft Excel program and the SAS package. Results were as follows: 92.3 percent of the patients were female and 7.7 percent were male, with a mean age of 42.7 years (range, 3 to 83 years). Patients underwent aesthetic (95.6 percent) and reconstructive (4.4 percent) plastic surgery procedures. Same-session multiple procedures occurred in 24.8 percent of patients. The vast majority of patients were healthy: 84.3 percent of patients were American Society of Anesthesiologists class I, 15.6 percent were class II, and 0.1 percent were class III. The operations required a mean of III minutes. There were no deaths, ventilator requirements, deep venous thromboses, or pulmonary emboli. Complications were as follows: 0.05 percent (n = 2) of patients had dyspnea that resolved, 0.2 percent (n = 6) of patients had protracted nausea and vomiting, and 0.05 percent (n = 2) of patients had unplanned hospital admissions (<24 hours). One patient had an emergent intubation. No prolonged adverse effects were noted. There was a 30-day follow-up minimum. Outpatient surgery is an important aspect of plastic surgery It was shown that office-based surgery with intravenous; sedation, performed by board-certified plastic surgeons and nurse anesthetists, is safe. Appropriate accreditation, safe anesthesia protocols, and proper patient selection constitute the basis for safe and efficacious office-based outpatient plastic surgery.","Bitar, G; Mullis, W; Jacobs, W; Matthews, D; Beasley, M; Smith, K; Watterson, P; Getz, S; Capizzi, P; Eaves, F",2003,"PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY"
"HYPNOSIS AS ADJUNCT THERAPY IN CONSCIOUS SEDATION FOR PLASTIC-SURGERY","Background and Objectives. Sedation is often requested during local and regional anesthesia. However, some surgical procedures, such as plastic surgery require conscious sedation, which may be difficult to achieve. Hypnosis, used routinely to provide conscious sedation in the authors' Department of Plastic Surgery, results in high patient and surgeon satisfaction. The authors conducted a retrospective study to investigate the benefits of hypnosis in supplementing local anesthesia. Methods. The study included 337 patients undergoing minor and major plastic surgical procedures under local anesthesia and conscious intravenous sedation. Patients were divided into three groups depending on the sedation technique: intravenous sedation (n = 137) using only midazolam and alfentanil; hypnosis (n = 172), during which patients achieved a hypnotic trance level with age regression; and relaxation (n = 28), comprising patients in whom hypnosis was induced without attaining a trance level. In all three groups, midazolam and alfentanil were titrated to achieve patient immobility, in response to patient complaints, and to maintain hemodynamic stability. Midazolam and alfentanil requirements; intra- and postoperative pain scores; as well as pre-, intra-, and postoperative anxiety scores, reported on a 10-cm visual analog scale, were recorded and compared in the three groups. Results. Intraoperative anxiety reported by patients in the hypnosis group (0.7 +/- 0.11) and in the relaxation group (2.08 +/- 0.4) was significantly (P < .001) less than in the intravenous sedation group (5.6 +/- 1.6). Pain scores during surgery were significantly greater in the intravenous sedation group (4.9 +/- 0.6) than in the hypnosis group (1.36 +/- 0.12; P < .001) and the relaxation group (1.82 +/- 0.6; P < .01). Furthermore, midazolam requirements were significantly lower in the hypnosis group (P < .001) and in the relaxation group (P < .01) as compared with the intravenous sedation group: respectively, 0.04 +/- 0.002, 0.07 +/- 0.005, and 0.11 +/- 0.01 mg/kg/h. Alfentanil requirements were significantly decreased in the hypnosis group, as compared with the intravenous sedation group: 10.2 +/- 0.6 mu g/kg/h versus 15.5 +/- 2.07 mu g/kg/h; P < .002. In the relaxation group, alfentanil requirements were 14.3 +/- 1.5 mu g/kg/h (ns). Postoperative nausea and vomiting were reported by 1.2% of patients in the hypnosis group, 12.8% in the relaxation group and 26.7% in the intravenous sedation group. Greater patient satisfaction with the anesthetic procedure and greater surgical comfort were also reported in the hypnosis group. Conclusions. Successful hypnosis as an adjunct sedation procedure to conscious intravenous sedation provided better pain and anxiety relief than conventional intravenous sedation and allowed for a significant reduction in midazolam and alfentanil requirements. Patient satisfaction was significantly improved.","FAYMONVILLE, ME; FISSETTE, J; MAMBOURG, PH; ROEDIGER, L; JORIS, J; LAMY, M",1995,"REGIONAL ANESTHESIA"
"Simulation in Plastic Surgery Training and Education: The Path Forward","Computer-based training simulators have been used extensively, most notably in flight simulation. Over the past 20 years, surgical simulators have been developed, initially for training of minimally invasive surgery and more recently for open surgical simulation. The key effort in today's surgical simulation field is to develop metrics to evaluate how well the skills learned in a simulator translate to improvement in real surgical skills, execution of procedures, and team cooperation in the operating room. The American College of Surgeons has begun implementing a phased approach to introduce simulation in training and education for general surgery. The authors believe that a similar training plan should be mandated for plastic surgery, to take advantage of the use of computers, virtual reality, and simulation in the training of plastic surgery residents and to explore the value of this technology for continuing medical education and maintenance of certification. This article gives a brief background and history of surgical simulation and its technology, followed by a detailed description of the three phases of the American College of Surgeons' plan and how the authors propose that each phase be implemented, with modifications as applicable for trainees in plastic surgery.

"Plastic Surgery: A New Dimension to Face Recognition","Advancement and affordability is leading to the popularity of plastic surgery procedures. Facial plastic surgery can be reconstructive to correct facial feature anomalies or cosmetic to improve the appearance. Both corrective as well as cosmetic surgeries alter the original facial information to a large extent thereby posing a great challenge for face recognition algorithms. The contribution of this research is 1) preparing a face database of 900 individuals for plastic surgery, and 2) providing an analytical and experimental underpinning of the effect of plastic surgery on face recognition algorithms. The results on the plastic surgery database suggest that it is an arduous research challenge and the current state-of-art face recognition algorithms are unable to provide acceptable levels of identification performance. Therefore, it is imperative to initiate a research effort so that future face recognition systems will be able to address this important problem.","Singh, R; Vatsa, M; Bhatt, HS; Bharadwaj, S; Noore, A; Nooreyezdan, SS",2010,"IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION FORENSICS AND SECURITY"

"Resident Selection Protocols in Plastic Surgery: A National Survey of Plastic Surgery Program Directors","Background: With the transition of many plastic surgery training programs from the traditional to the integrated/coordinated model, critical evaluation of the process by which medical students are selected for residency is needed. To increase the understanding of this process and to improve the manner in which candidates are vetted, a survey study was designed. Methods: A 29-question online survey was designed to discern desired qualities regarding resident selection, interview processes, resident participation, and program director satisfaction with the current process. This survey was sent to all 49 integrated/ coordinated program directors in the United States. Results: Forty-three of 49 program directors (87.8 percent) responded. High-quality letters of recommendation (author and substance) and performance on subinternship rotations and interviews were considered the most important qualities in selecting residents. Candidates' interview performance and rank order list position were considered by many to be indicative of resident quality, but responses varied. Forty-two of 43 program directors reported that their own residents participate in the interview and/or selection process. Overall, only 43.2 percent of respondents found the current process adequate for identifying potential problems. Furthermore, 39.5 percent of programs have dismissed a resident for academic or ethical reasons within the last 10 years. Conclusions: Residency selection is a relatively subjective, unstandardized process. Because medical school performance is not always indicative of ultimate resident quality, it is imperative that integrated/ coordinated plastic surgery training programs improve selection protocols to discern who will most likely become a successful resident. A number of program directors are dissatisfied with the process, and better systems for selection would be beneficial. (Plast. Reconstr.

"Safety and efficacy in an accredited outpatient plastic surgery facility: A review of 5316 consecutive cases","Advances in medicine have improved the delivery of health care, making it more technologically superior than ever and, at the same time, more complex. Nowhere is this more evident than in the surgical arena. Plastic surgeons are able to perform procedures safely in office-based facilities that were once reserved only for hospital operating rooms or ambulatory surgery centers. Performing procedures in the office is a convenience to both the surgeon and the patient. Some groups have challenged that performing plastic surgery procedures in an office-based facility compromises patient safety. Our study was done to determine whether outcomes are adversely affected by performing plastic surgery procedures in an accredited outpatient surgical center. A retrospective review was performed on 5316 consecutive cases completed between 1995 and 2000 at Dallas Day Surgical Center, Dallas, Texas, an outpatient surgical facility. Most cases were cosmetic procedures. All cases were analyzed for any potential morbidity or mortality. Complications requiring a return to the operating room were determined, as were infection rates. Events leading to inpatient hospitalization were also included. During this 6-year period, 35 complications (0.7 percent) and no deaths were reported. Most complications were secondary to hematoma formation (77 percent). The postoperative infection rate for patients requiring a return to the operating room was 0.11 percent. Seven patients required inpatient hospitalization following their procedure secondary to arrhythmias, angina, and pulmonary emboli. Patient safety must take precedence over cost and convenience. Any monetary savings or time gained is quickly lost if safety is compromised and complications are incurred. The safety profile of the outpatient facility must meet and even exceed that of the traditional hospital-based or ambulatory care facility. After reviewing our experience over the last 6 years that indicated few complications and no deaths, we continue to support the judicious use of accredited outpatient surgical facilities by board-certified plastic surgeons in the management of plastic surgery patients.","Byrd, HS; Barton, FE; Orenstein, HH; Rohrich, RJ; Burns, AJ; Hobar, C; Haydon, MS",2003,"PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY"
"The Influence of Social Media and Easily Accessible Online Information on the Aesthetic Plastic Surgery Practice: Literature Review and Our Own Experience","Patients interested in aesthetic plastic surgery procedures increasingly seek advice on social media and rely on easily accessible online information. The investigatory goal was to determine the impact of this phenomenon on the everyday aesthetic plastic surgery practice. Five hundred consecutive patients completed a questionnaire prior to their consultation with a plastic surgeon at our clinic. A questionnaire was also completed by 128 plastic surgeons practising in 19 different countries. A literature review was performed. Almost all patients (95 %) used the internet to collect information prior to consultation, for 68 % of them it being their first search method. Social media were used by 46 % of patients and 40 % of these were strongly influenced when choosing a specific doctor. The majority of plastic surgeons (85 %) thought the information found on social media could lead to unrealistic expectations. However, 45 % of plastic surgeons believed that their consultations became easier after the advent of social media, 29 % found them more difficult. A literature review showed a high percentage of poor quality internet websites regarding plastic surgery and an increase in use of social media among plastic surgeons. The internet and social media play an important and growing role in plastic surgery. This results in more informed patients but may create unrealistic expectations. Even if the internet provides ample information, it cannot replace the face-to-face consultation, which always should remain a detailed process, covering both risks and limitations of alternative procedures. Available literature on how social media influences the medical practice is still scarce and further research is needed. This journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

"The clinical applications of human amnion in plastic surgery","Since the early 1900s, human amnion has been applied to a wide variety of clinical scenarios including burns, chronic ulcers, dural defects, intra-abdominal adhesions, peritoneal reconstruction, genital reconstruction, hip arthroplasty, tendon repair, nerve repair, microvascular reconstruction, corneal repair, intra-oral reconstruction and reconstruction of the nasal lining and tympanic membrane. Amnion epithelial and mesenchymal cells have been shown to contain a variety of regulatory mediators that result in the promotion of cellular proliferation, differentiation and epithelialisation and the inhibition of fibrosis, immune rejection, inflammation and bacterial invasion. The full repertoire of biological factors that these cells synthesise, store and release and the mechanisms by which these factors exert their beneficial effects are only now being fully appreciated. Although many commercially available biological and synthetic alternatives to amnion exist, ethical, religious, and financial constraints may limit the widespread utilisation of these products. Amnion is widely available, economical and is easy to manipulate, process and store. Although many clinical applications are of historical interest only, amnion offers an alternative source of multi-potent or pluripotent stem cells and therefore may yet have a great deal to offer the plastic surgery and regenerative medicine community. It is the purpose of this article to review the clinical applications of human amnion relevant to plastic surgery. (C) 2014 British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons.

"Patient-based measures of outcome in plastic surgery: current approaches and future directions","Objectives. To evaluate current approaches to patient-based outcome measurement in plastic surgery and make recommendations for future research. Methods. Comprehensive review of the plastic surgery Literature relevant to patient-based outcomes. Results. Two main types of patient-based outcome measure have been used in the plastic surgery literature: generic and disease-specific. The majority of studies using generic measures investigate aspects of psychological functioning with fewer studies focussing on wider aspects of health-related quality of life. Disease-specific measures are mainly used to assess symptoms. However, almost all of these are ad-hoc measures produced for a particular study, with no psychometric evaluation. Conclusions. There is a lack of psychometrically sound measures, and there is scope for improvement in methodology used in plastic surgery research. The development and psychometric testing of new plastic surgery specific measures is encouraged. (C) 2003 The British Association of Plastic Surgeons. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

"Female Genital Cosmetic and Plastic Surgery: A Review","Introduction. This review studies rationale and outcome of vulvovaginal aesthetic surgery. Aim. Discuss procedures designed to alter genital appearance and function; investigate sexual, philosophical, and ethical issues; examine outcomes. Methods. (i) Medline search of the existing literature utilizing terms labiaplasty, clitoral hood reduction, hymenoplasty (HP), vaginoplasty (VP), perineoplasty (PP), female genital surgery, sexual satisfaction/body image, and anterior/posterior colporrhaphy; (ii) references from bibliographies of papers found through the literature search and in the author's reading of available literature. Main Outcome Measures. (i) Demographics and psychosexual dynamics of women requesting female genital plastic/cosmetic surgery; (ii) overall and sexual satisfaction of subjects undergoing these procedures. Results. The majority of studies regarding patient satisfaction and sexual function after vaginal aesthetic and functional plastic procedures report beneficial results, with overall patient satisfaction in the 90-95% range, sexual satisfaction over 80-85%. These data are supported by outcome data from nonelective vaginal support procedures. Complications appear minor and acceptable to patients. There are little data available regarding outcomes and satisfaction of HP, or function during the rigors of subsequent vaginal childbirth, although the literature contains no case reports of labiaplasty disruption during parturition. Conclusion. Women requesting labiaplasty and reduction of their clitoral hoods do so for both cosmetic and functional (chafing, interference with coitus, interference with athletic activities, etc.) reasons, while patients requesting VP and/or PP do so in order to increase friction and sexual satisfaction, occasionally for aesthetic reasons. Patients appear generally happy with outcomes. The majority of patients undergoing genital plastic surgery report overall satisfaction and subjective enhancement of sexual function and body image, but the literature is retrospective. Female genital plastic surgery procedures appear to fulfill the majority of patient's desires for cosmetic and functional improvement, as well as enhancement of the sexual experience.

"Evidence-based periodontal plastic surgery: an assessment of quality of systematic reviews in the treatment of recession-type defects","P>Objective To assess methods, quality and outcomes of systematic reviews (SRs) conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of root coverage (RC) procedures in the treatment of recession-type defects (RTD). Methods MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched up to and including April 2010 to identify SRs investigating the effectiveness/efficacy of surgical interventions for the treatment of patients with RTD. Searching was conducted independently by two reviewers, and data extraction was based on the methodological criteria applied and on the effects of interventions reported by each SR. The checklist proposed by Glenny and colleagues, the Overview Quality Assessment Questionnaire and the ""Assessment of Multiple systematic Reviews"", instrument were used to assess the quality of SRs. Additionally, the methodological criteria applied by included reviews were compared with those proposed by the Cochrane Collaboration. Results Search strategy identified 716 potentially eligible articles, of which 12 papers regarding 10 SRs were included in the study. Results from different SRs showed that subepithelial connective tissue grafts associated or not to coronally advanced flaps can be used to reduce recession depth and improve the width of keratinized tissue. All quality assessment tools showed that most of the SRs were of good methodological quality, but they also highlighted key points that could be improved in future reviews. Only two SRs followed in full the guidelines proposed by the Cochrane Collaboration. Conclusions All SRs agree that RC may be anticipated by different surgical procedures. However, differences in the methodological quality between reviews were quite evident, and thus making a clear indication that there is a need of standardization of the methods that will be applied by future SRs. As a result, a standardized checklist for reporting SRs was proposed by the authors.","Chambrone, L; Faggion, CM; Pannuti, CM; Chambrone, LA",2010,"JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PERIODONTOLOGY"

"The Impact of Operative Time on Complications After Plastic Surgery: A Multivariate Regression Analysis of 1753 Cases","Background: Little evidence within plastic surgery literature supports the precept that longer operative times lead to greater morbidity. Objective: The authors investigate surgery duration as a determinant of morbidity, with the goal of defining a clinically relevant time for increased risk. Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted of patients who underwent a broad range of complex plastic surgical procedures (n = 1801 procedures) at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, Texas, from January 1, 2008 to January 31, 2012. Adjusting for possible confounders, multivariate logistic regression assessed surgery duration as an independent predictor of morbidity. To define a cutoff for increased risk, incidence of complications was compared among quintiles of surgery duration. Stratification by type of surgery controlled for procedural complexity. Results: A total of 1753 cases were included in multivariate analyses with an overall complication rate of 27.8%. Most operations were combined (75.8%), averaging 4.9 concurrent procedures. Each hour increase in surgery duration was associated with a 21% rise in odds of morbidity (P < .0001). Compared with the first quintile of operative time (<2.0 hours), there was no change in complications until after 3.1 hours of surgery (odds ratio, 1.6; P = .017), with progressively greater odds increases of 3.1 times after 4.5 hours (P < .0001) and 4.7 times after 6.8 hours (P < .0001). When stratified by type of surgery, longer operations continued to be associated with greater morbidity. Conclusions: Surgery duration is an independent predictor of complications, with a significantly increased risk above 3 hours. Although procedural complexity undoubtedly affects morbidity, operative time should factor into surgical decision making.

"The influence of plastic surgery ""reality TV"" on cosmetic surgery patient expectations and decision making","Background: The aim of this study was to survey first-time patients seeking cosmetic surgery and examine what role ""reality TV' played in their perception of the risks and benefits of surgery and their overall decision-making process. Methods: Information on demographics, television viewing patterns, and patients' self-assessed plastic surgery knowledge was collected from 42 patients. They were asked how similar they believed the shows were to real life and what degree of influence the shows had on their decision to pursue cosmetic surgery. Patients were then divided into groups by program viewing intensity. Results: Fifty-seven percent of patients were ""high-intensity"" viewers of plastic surgery reality television shows. When compared with low-intensity viewers, high-intensity viewers believed themselves to be more knowledgeable about plastic surgery (p < 0.05) and believed the shows were more similar to real life (p < 0.05). Overall, four of five patients reported that television influenced them to pursue a cosmetic surgery procedure, with nearly one-third feeling ""very much"" or ""moderately"" influenced. Conclusions: Plastic surgery reality television plays a significant role in cosmetic surgery patient perceptions and decision making. Patients who regularly watched one or more reality television show reported a greater influence from television and media to pursue cosmetic surgery, felt more knowledgeable about cosmetic surgery in general, and felt that plastic surgery reality television was more similar to real life than did low-intensity viewers.","Crockett, RJ; Pruzinsky, T; Persing, JA",2007,"PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY"
"Social Media in Plastic Surgery Practices: Emerging Trends in North America","Background: Social media is a common term for web-based applications that offer a way to disseminate information to a targeted audience in real time. In the current market, many businesses are utilizing it to communicate with clients. Although the field of plastic surgery is constantly changing in response to innovative technologies introduced into the specialty, the utilization of social media in plastic surgery practices is currently unclear. Objectives: The authors evaluate the current attitudes and practices of aesthetic surgeons to emerging social media technology and compare these to attitudes about more traditional modes of communication. Methods: A 19-question web-based survey was disseminated by e-mail to all board-certified or board-eligible American plastic surgeons (n = 4817). Respondents were asked to answer questions on three topics: (1) their use of social media in their personal and professional lives, (2) their various forms of practice marketing, and (3) their demographic information. Results: There were 1000 responses (20.8%). Results showed that 28.2% of respondents used social media in their practice, while 46.7% used it in their personal life. Most plastic surgeons managed their social media themselves or through a staff member. The majority of respondents who used social media in their practice claimed that their efforts were directed toward patient referrals. The typical plastic surgery practice that used social media was a solo practice in a large city with a focus on cosmetic surgery. Local competition of plastic surgeons did not correlate with social media use. Most plastic surgeons (88%) advertised, but the form of marketing varied. The most common forms included websites, print, and search engine optimization, but other modalities, such as television, radio, and billboards, were still utilized. Conclusions: Social media represents a new avenue that many plastic surgeons are utilizing, although with trepidation. As social media becomes commonplace in society, its role in plastic surgery practice development and communication will become more prominent and defined.","Wheeler, CK; Said, H; Prucz, R; Rodrich, RJ; Mathes, DW",2011,"AESTHETIC SURGERY JOURNAL"

Patients with psychological disturbances of a magnitude generally considered an ""absolute contraindication"" for surgery were operated on and later assessed to determine the psychological impact of surgery. Patient follow-up averaged 6.2 years (maximum follow-up 25.7 years). Of the 87 patients who underwent operation (7 patients were refused surgery and 6 voluntarily deferred surgery), 82.8 percent had a positive psychological outcome, 13.8 percent experienced ""minimal"" improvement from surgery, and 3.4 percent were negatively affected by surgery. There were no lawsuits, suicides, or psychotic decompensations. Patients with severe psychological disturbances frequently benefited from combined surgical-psychiatric treatment designed to address the patient's profound sense of deformity. This study suggests that plastic surgeons are ""passing up"" a significant number of patients who may be helped by combined surgical-psychological intervention.","EDGERTON, MT; LANGMAN, MW; PRUZINSKY, T",1991,"PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY"

All surgeons used clinical assessment, although there was significant disparity in the duration and frequency of postoperative monitoring. Adjuvant techniques such as laser Doppler flowmetry were routinely used by less than 20% of surgeons. We conclude that there is considerable variation in postoperative monitoring of free flaps, with significant clinical and resource implications.

"Association Among Facial Paralysis, Depression, and Quality of Life in Facial Plastic Surgery Patients","IMPORTANCE Though anecdotally linked, few studies have investigated the impact of facial paralysis on depression and quality of life (QOL). OBJECTIVE To measure the association between depression, QOL, and facial paralysis in patients seeking treatment at a facial plastic surgery clinic. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS Data were prospectively collected for patients with all-cause facial paralysis and control patients initially presenting to a facial plastic surgery clinic from 2013 to 2015. The control group included a heterogeneous patient population presenting to facial plastic surgery clinic for evaluation. Patients who had prior facial reanimation surgery or missing demographic and psychometric data were excluded from analysis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Demographics, facial paralysis etiology, facial paralysis severity (graded on the House-Brackmann scale), Beck depression inventory, and QOL scores in both groups were examined. Potential confounders, including self-reported attractiveness and mood, were collected and analyzed. Self-reported scores were measured using a 0 to 100 visual analog scale. RESULTS There was a total of 263 patients (mean age, 48.8 years; 66.9% were female) were analyzed. There were 175 control patients and 88 patients with facial paralysis. Sex distributions were not significantly different between the facial paralysis and control groups. Patients with facial paralysis had significantly higher depression, lower self-reported attractiveness, lower mood, and lower QOL scores. Overall, 37 patients with facial paralysis (42.1%) screened positive for depression, with the greatest likelihood in patients with House-Brackmann grade 3 or greater (odds ratio, 10.8; 95% CI, 5.13-22.75) compared with 13 control patients (8.1%) (P <.001). In multivariate regression, facial paralysis and female sex were significantly associated with higher depression scores (constant, 2.08 [95% CI, 0.77-3.39]; facial paralysis effect, 5.98 [95% CI, 4.38-7.58]; female effect, 1.95 [95% CI, 0.65-3.25]). Facial paralysis was associated with lower QOL scores (constant, 81.62 [95% CI, 78.98-84.25]; facial paralysis effect, -16.06 [95% CI, -20.50 to -11.62]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE For treatment-seeking patients, facial paralysis was significantly associated with increased depression and worse QOL scores. In addition, female sex was significantly associated with increased depression scores. Moreover, patients with a greater severity of facial paralysis were more likely to screen positive for depression. Clinicians initially evaluating patients should consider the psychological impact of facial paralysis to optimize care.","Nellis, JC; Ishii, M; Byrne, PJ; Boahene, KDO; Dey, JK; Ishii, LE",2017,"JAMA FACIAL PLASTIC SURGERY"
"Social Media and the Plastic Surgery Patient","Background: Many plastic surgeons use social media as a marketing tool to attract and retain patients, but information about how patients use social media and their preferred types of plastic surgery posts have been lacking. Methods: To investigate patients' preferred social media networks and the type of posts they wished to see, a cross-sectional study was conducted in a single aesthetic practice of two plastic surgeons by surveying 100 consecutive patients. Results: The age of the patients averaged 44.4 years (range, 17 to 78 years). Facebook had the greatest patient use and engagement, with YouTube second in use, and Instagram second in number of engaged users. Over half used Pinterest, but with little daily engagement. Only one-fourth used Snapchat, but the percentage of users who were highly engaged was second only to Facebook. The least popular network was Twitter, with the fewest patient users and least engagement. Social media played a minor role compared with the practice's Web site in both influencing patients to choose the practice and providing information on the day of the appointment. Patients most wanted to see posts on a plastic surgeon's social media platform related to practice information, before-and-after photographs, and contests. Articles about plastic surgery held the least interest. Among five types of Web site content, patients expressed most interest in before-and-after photographs. Conclusions: This study is the first to articulate the plastic surgery patient perspective regarding social media. The findings aim to help plastic surgeons maximize their influence on their target audience.","Sorice, SC; Li, AY; Gilstrap, J; Canales, FL; Furnas, HJ",2017,"PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY"
"Research Productivity and Gender Disparities: A Look at Academic Plastic Surgery","OBJECTIVES: The h-index has utility in examining the contributions of faculty members by quantifying both the amount and the quality of research output and as such is a metric in approximating academic productivity. The objectives of this study were (1) to evaluate the relationship between h-index and academic rank in plastic surgery and (2) to describe the current gender representation in academic plastic surgery to assess whether there are any gender disparities in academic productivity. DESIGN: The h-index was used to evaluate the research contributions of plastic surgeons from academic departments the United States. RESULTS: There were 426 (84%) men and 79 (16%) women in our sample. Those in higher academic ranks had higher h-index scores (p < 0.0005). There was a significant difference in overall mean h-index by gender, where the mean scores were 9.0 and 6.0 for men and women, respectively (p = 0.0005). When analyzed by academic rank, there was a significant difference in academic productivity between men and women in assistant and associate professor positions (6.4 vs 5.1, respectively; p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: The h-index is able to objectively and reliably quantify academic productivity in plastic surgery. We found that h-indices increased with higher academic rank, and men had overall higher scores than their female colleagues. Adoption of this metric as an adjunct to other objective and subjective measures by promotions committees may provide a more reliable measure of research relevance and academic productivity in academic plastic surgery.

Comparison of the two questionnaires permitted the change in Quality of Life (QoL) to be measured. Overall, of the respondents, 73% gained benefit from surgery in terms of improvement in QoL. The largest gains were in the breast surgery group, but there were individual patients in all groups who gained substantial improvement in QoL. The results suggest that the HMQ is a useful method of measuring benefit in patients admitted for low priority plastic surgery procedures.","COLE, RP; SHAKESPEARE, V; SHAKESPEARE, P; HOBBY, JAE",1994,"BRITISH JOURNAL OF PLASTIC SURGERY"

"Antibiotic Prophylaxis for Preventing Surgical-Site Infection in Plastic Surgery: An Evidence-Based Consensus Conference Statement from the American Association of Plastic Surgeons","Background: There is a growing concern for microbial resistance as a result of overuse of antibiotics. Although guidelines have focused on the use of antibiotics for surgery in general, few have addressed plastic surgery specifically. The objective of this expert consensus conference was to evaluate the evidence for efficacy and safety of antibiotic prophylaxis in plastic surgical procedures. Methods: The authors searched for existing high-quality systematic reviews for antibiotic prophylaxis in the literature from the MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and Embase databases. All synonyms for antibiotics were combined with terms for relevant plastic surgery procedures. The searches were not limited by language, and included all study designs. In addition, supplemental hand searches were performed of bibliographies of relevant articles, and extensive ""related articles."" Meta-analyses were performed and reviewed by experts selected by the American Association of Plastic Surgeons to reach consensus recommendations. Results: Database searches identified 4300 articles, from which 2042 full-text articles were identified for eligibility. De novo meta-analyses were performed for each plastic surgical category. In total, 67 studies met the inclusion criteria, including nine for breast surgery, 17 for head and neck surgery, 10 for orthognathic surgery, seven for rhinoplasty/septoplasty, 19 for hand surgery, five for skin surgery, and two for abdominoplasty. Conclusions: Systemic antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended for clean breast surgery and for contaminated surgery of the hand or the head and neck. It is not recommended to reduce infection in clean surgical cases of the hand, skin, head and neck, or abdominoplasty.","Ariyan, S; Martin, J; Lal, A; Cheng, D; Borah, GL; Chung, KC; Conly, J; Havlik, R; Lee, WPA; McGrath, MH; Pribaz, J; Young, VL",2015,"PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY"
"Resident Involvement and Plastic Surgery Outcomes: An Analysis of 10,356 Patients from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Database","Background: Intraoperative experience is an essential component of surgical training. The impact of resident involvement in plastic surgery has not previously been studied on a large scale. Methods: The authors retrospectively reviewed the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database from 2006 to 2010 for all reconstructive plastic surgery cases. Resident involvement was tracked as an individual variable to compare outcomes. Results: A total of 10,356 cases were identified, with 43 percent noted as having resident involvement. The average total relative value units, a proxy for surgical complexity, and operative time were higher for procedures with residents present. When balanced by baseline characteristics using propensity score stratification into quintiles, no differences in graft, prosthesis, or flap failure or mortality were observed. Furthermore, there were no differences in overall complications or wound infection with resident involvement for a majority of the quintiles. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that resident involvement was a significant predictor of overall morbidity, but not associated with increased odds of wound infection, graft, prosthesis or flap failure, or overall mortality. Conclusions: Residency has the dual mission of training future physicians and also providing critical support for academic medical centers. Using a large-scale, multicenter database, the authors were able to confirm that well-matched cohorts with-and without-resident presence had similar complication profiles. Moreover, even when residents were involved in comparably more complex cases with longer operative times, infection, graft and flap failure, and mortality remained similar. (Plast. Reconstr.

"Plastic Surgery After Gastric Bypass Improves Long-Term Quality of Life","Excess skin after massive weight loss impairs patient's health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Therefore, body-contouring surgeries can be proposed. However, few data exist concerning the effect of body contouring after bariatric surgery on HRQoL, including control group with a long-term follow-up. In a prospective study, 98 consecutive patients who had body contouring after gastric bypass for obesity (BMI > 40) were included (group A). A matched control-group containing 102 patients who had only gastric bypass was selected (group B). HRQoL was measured by Moorehead-Ardelt questionnaire before (group A1) and after (A2) body contouring, and at different time points for group B until 8 years post-gastric bypass. To evaluate the effect of body contouring by two parallel methods, HRQoL was compared between groups A1 and A2, and between A2 and B. We found that body contouring procedures improved significantly patients' HRQoL, in comparison to those who had only gastric bypass. Of the patients who had body contouring (group A2), 57 % evaluated their HRQoL ""much better"" in comparison to only 22 % of patients before body contouring (group A1) or those who never had body contouring (group B) (p < 0.001). The improvement was significant in all sub-domains of HRQoL: self-esteem, social life, work ability, sexual activity and physical activity (p < 0.001), and remained stable over time. Our study confirms the important role of plastic surgery in treatment of patients after massive weight loss. We demonstrated that body contouring, despite important scars, significantly improves satisfaction and HRQoL of patients after gastric bypass. Therefore, the treatment of morbid obesity should not be deemed achieved unless plastic surgery has been considered.","Modarressi, A; Balague, N; Huber, O; Chilcott, M; Pittet-Cuenod, B",2013,"OBESITY SURGERY"

"Assessment of Postoperative Venous Thromboembolism Risk in Plastic Surgery Patients Using the 2005 and 2010 Caprini Risk Score","Background: Venous thromboembolism is an important patient safety issue. The authors sought to compare the predictive capacity of the 2005 and 2010 Caprini Risk Assessment Models for perioperative venous thromboembolism risk. Methods: The authors performed a retrospective, observational, crossover study using an established surgical outcomes database. A total of 3334 adult plastic surgery patients were identified. Patients were risk-stratified using both the 2005 and 2010 Caprini Risk Assessment Models. Each patient served as his or her own control, resulting in precise matching for identified and unidentified confounders. The outcome of interest was 60-day, symptomatic venous thromboembolism. The predictive capacities of the 2005 and 2010 Caprini risk scores were compared. Results: Use of the 2010 Caprini Risk Assessment Model resulted in a systematic increase in the aggregate risk score. The median 2010 Caprini score was significantly higher than the median 2005 Caprini score (6 versus 5, p < 0.001). When compared with the 2010 model, the 2005 Caprini Risk Assessment Model was able to better separate the lowest and highest risk patients from one another. Patients classified as ""super-high"" risk (Caprini score >8) using the 2005 Caprini Risk Assessment Model were significantly more likely to have a 60-day venous thromboembolism event when compared with patients classified as super-high risk using the 2010 guidelines (5.85 percent versus 2.52 percent, p = 0.021). Conclusions: When compared with the 2010 Caprini Risk Assessment Model, the 2005 Caprini Risk Assessment Model provides superior risk stratification. The 2005 Caprini Risk Assessment Model is the more appropriate method to risk-stratify plastic surgery patients for perioperative venous thromboembolism risk. (Plast. Reconstr.

"Telemedicine and plastic surgery: A review of its applications, limitations and legal pitfalls","Background: Telemedicine is a rapidly expanding technology involving the exchange of medical information to assist diagnosis and treatment at a distance. Within the field of plastic surgery, where visual examination contributes heavily to patient management decision-making, telemedicine has great potential. However, privacy and medico-legal issues must be considered when using electronic communication to assist our clinical practice. Methods: A comprehensive literature review of manuscripts published on telemedicine was performed. Articles were selected for relevance to plastic and reconstructive surgery and reviewed for applications, benefits and complications of telemedicine. In addition, the manuscripts were reviewed for conforming to current legal guidelines for the electronic transfer of patient information. Results: Twenty-nine articles met the inclusion criteria (11 trauma and burns, 4 hand, 5 wound-care, 5 maxillofacial, 1 digital replantation, 2 free-flap monitoring, and 1 technical application). Twenty-eight (96%) manuscripts reported a benefit of telemedicine (commonly including increased access to expertise and costs saved through reduction of unnecessary transfers). However only five (17%) reported a statistical benefit compared to a standard treatment cohort (face-to-face interactions). Fifteen (51%) reported on adverse effects, which included misdiagnosis, time consumption, training, technical and cost issues. Only four manuscripts (14%) discussed conforming to legal guidelines within their institution. Conclusions: Telemedicine can improve access to the specialty of plastic surgery by facilitating the provision of expertise at remote sites. Its application can be used in many situations and between a variety of healthcare professionals. However, there is little critical analysis on the benefits and risks of telemedicine. In addition, its legal implications need to be carefully considered if it is to be safely integrated into our daily practice.

"Indocyanine green applications in plastic surgery: A review of the literature","Introduction: Use of indocyanine green (ICG) near-infrared fluorescence as a dye to assess tissue vascularization is now well standardized. The aimof this literature review was to review and resume the most recent recommendations for ICG use in its plastic surgery applications. Methods: A systematic literature review was performed using Medline, EMBASE, and PubMed databases to obtain the latest recommendations for ICG in plastic surgery. Inclusion criteriawere all articles written in English language that evaluated pre-, intra-, or postoperative ICG applications in surgical procedures usually performed by plastic surgeons. Case reports, reviews, meta-analyses, and experimental studies on animals or cadavers were excluded after title and abstract screening. Results: Of the 1389 article titles retrieved, 41 full-text articles met the inclusion criteria. ICG applications in plastic surgery were ICG lymphangiography used in sentinel lymph node mapping for breast cancer and melanoma and in microsurgery for the staging and treatment of secondary chronic lymphedema. The latest updates of ICG angiography in assessing free flaps, pedicled flaps, or large skin paddles were also retrieved. Conclusions: Large prospective studies suggest that ICG lymphography could be used as a single tracer to reliably perform sentinel lymph node biopsy. In the case of cutaneous melanoma, ICG lymphography increases node detection sensitivity and accuracy in conjunction with lymphoscintigraphy. In chronic lymphedema, it is useful for pre-and postoperative staging and intraoperative anatomical location of lymphatic pathways when lymphovenous bypass is indicated. ICG angiography is used intraoperatively to assess free flap anastomosis and design skin paddles and postoperatively to monitor buried flaps. In pedicled perforator flaps or for large skin paddles, intraoperative ICG angiography is strongly correlated with postoperative outcomes.

"The Plastic Surgery Hypothesis","Recent work on genetic-programming-based approaches to automatic program patching have relied on the insight that the content of new code can often be assembled out of fragments of code that already exist in the code base. This insight has been dubbed the plastic surgery hypothesis; successful, well-known automatic repair tools such as GenProg rest on this hypothesis, but it has never been validated. We formalize and validate the plastic surgery hypothesis and empirically measure the extent to which raw material for changes actually already exists in projects. In this paper, we mount a large-scale study of several large Java projects, and examine a history of 15,723 commits to determine the extent to which these commits are graftable, i.e., can be reconstituted from existing code, and find an encouraging degree of graftability, surprisingly independent of commit size and type of commit. For example, we find that changes are 43% graftable from the exact version of the software being changed. With a view to investigating the difficulty of finding these grafts, we study the abundance of such grafts in three possible sources: the immediately previous version, prior history, and other projects. We also examine the contiguity or chunking of these grafts, and the degree to which grafts can be found in the same file. Our results are quite promising and suggest an optimistic future for automatic program patching methods that search for raw material in already extant code in the project being patched.","Barr, ET; Brun, Y; Devanbu, P; Harman, M; Sarro, F",2014,"22ND ACM SIGSOFT INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON THE FOUNDATIONS OF SOFTWARE ENGINEERING (FSE 2014)"
"Levels of Evidence in Plastic Surgery Research over 20 Years","Background: Evidence-based medicine, particularly randomized controlled trials, influences many daily decisions within the medical specialties. The structure of questions asked during the history and selection of physical examination maneuvers, diagnostic tests, and treatment regimens are all guided by evidence-based medicine. Implementation of evidence-based medicine has been slower in surgical practice. The purpose of this study was to survey published plastic surgery literature to evaluate changes in the level of evidence from pre-evidence-based medicine popularization to the present time. Methods: Articles from Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery for the years 1983, 1993, and 2003 were ranked by a five-point level of evidence scale. The highest level of evidence value (1) was given to randomized clinical trials and the lowest value (5) was given to individual case reports; 989 articles were ranked. Results: The average level of evidence of an article published in 1983 was lower than that of one published in 2003 (4.42 versus 4.16, respectively), and the majority of research (86.9 percent in 2003) remained largely uncontrolled and descriptive in nature. However, there was a trend toward higher-quality research. The percentage of studies with control or placebo groups nearly doubled from 1983 to 2003 (from 7.21 percent to 13.7 percent), and the number of randomized clinical trials increased (zero versus seven). Conclusion: The plastic surgery literature has responded to the demand for more evidence-based medicine, but the rate of change has been slow and the field will likely never enjoy the high level of evidence of medical fields.

"Adipocyte Transplantation and Stem Cells: Plastic Surgery Meets Regenerative Medicine","The technologies for adipose tissue harvesting, processing, and transplantation have substantially evolved in the past two decades. Clinically driven advancements have paralleled a significant improvement in the understanding of cellular, molecular, and immunobiological events surrounding cell and tissue transplantation. These new mechanistic insights could be of assistance to better understand the mechanisms underlying some of the observed clinical improvements. In addition to plastic and reconstructive surgical applications, adipose tissue has become central to an increasing number of translational efforts involving adipose tissue-derived progenitor cells. The growing interest in this area of research has resulted in the exploration of many novel research and clinical applications that utilize adipose tissue grafting and/or progenitor/stem cell-derived cell products obtained from this tissue source. Progenitor, endothelial, and mesenchymal stem cells derived from adipose tissue could therefore not only be central to plastic and reconstructive surgery applications, but also become the focus of an array of therapeutic solutions for many disease conditions, such as those affecting bone, cartilage, muscle, liver, kidney, cardiac, neural, and the pancreas, expanding the possible indications and translational potential of tissue, cell-based, and regenerative medicine strategies.","Tremolada, C; Palmieri, G; Ricordi, C",2010,"CELL TRANSPLANTATION"
"A Survey of Cosmetic Surgery Training in Plastic Surgery Programs in the United States","Background: Aesthetic surgery is evolving rapidly, both technologically and conceptually. It is critical for the specialty that aesthetic surgery training keep pace with this rapid evolution. To shed more light on this issue, a survey was sent to all program directors and senior plastic surgery residents to record their impressions of the quality of cosmetic surgery resident training. The authors report the results of this national cosmetic surgery training survey canvassing all 89 plastic surgery programs. Methods: A three-page survey delineating resident preparedness in aesthetic surgery was sent to senior plastic surgery residents and program directors in April of 2006 and collected through October of 2006. Results: Of 814 surveys, 292 responses were obtained from 64 percent of program directors and 33 percent of senior residents. Breast augmentation, breast reduction, and abdominoplasty were most frequently performed with the highest resident comfort levels. Rhinoplasty remained a particular area of trainee concern, but confidence levels were also low in face lifts, endoscopic procedures, and body contouring techniques. Experience with skin resurfacing, fillers, and botulinum toxin type A was another area of concern. Although 51 percent of residents felt prepared to integrate cosmetic surgery into their practices on graduation, 36 percent felt that further cosmetic training was desirable. Conclusions: The information collected revealed significant differences in opinions between program directors and senior residents. Senior residents felt deficient in facial cosmetic, minimally invasive, and recently developed body contouring techniques. On the basis of these results and the authors' experience in resident education, changes in cosmetic surgery training are suggested. (Plast. Reconstr.

We designed this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to examine the hypothesis that administration of celecoxib preoperatively or postoperatively and for 3 days after major plastic surgery would improve pain control and clinically important patient outcomes. Another objective of the study was to determine whether perioperative administration of celecoxib offered any advantages over postoperative administration alone. METHODS: One hundred and twenty healthy consenting patients undergoing major plastic surgery (e.g., breast augmentation, abdominoplasty procedures) using a standardized general anesthetic technique were randomized to one of three treatment groups: 1) control group (n = 40) received two placebos orally before and after surgery, as well as one placebo BID for 3 days after surgery; 2) postoperative group (n = 40) received two placebos before surgery and 2 celecoxib 200 mg po after surgery, followed by one celecoxib 200 mg po BID on postoperative day ","Sun, T; Sacan, O; White, PF; Coleman, J; Rohrich, RJ; Kenkel, JM",NA,"ANESTHESIA AND ANALGESIA"

"From the operating room to the courtroom: A comprehensive characterization of litigation related to facial plastic surgery procedures","Objectives/Hypothesis Malpractice litigation has increased in recent decades, contributing to higher health-care costs. Characterization of complications leading to litigation is of special interest to practitioners of facial plastic surgery procedures because of the higher proportion of elective cases relative to other subspecialties. In this analysis, we comprehensively examine malpractice litigation in facial plastic surgery procedures and characterize factors important in determining legal responsibility, as this information may be of great interest and use to practitioners in several specialties. Study Design Retrospective analysis. Methods The Westlaw legal database was examined for court records pertaining to facial plastic surgery procedures. The term medical malpractice was searched in combination with numerous procedures obtained from the American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery website. Results Of the 88 cases included, 62.5% were decided in the physician's favor, 9.1% were resolved with an out-of-court settlement, and 28.4% ended in a jury awarding damages for malpractice. The mean settlement was $577,437 and mean jury award was $352,341. The most litigated procedures were blepharoplasties and rhinoplasties. Alleged lack of informed consent was noted in 38.6% of cases; other common complaints were excessive scarring/disfigurement, functional considerations, and postoperative pain. Conclusions This analysis characterized factors in determining legal responsibility in facial plastic surgery cases. Several factors were identified as potential targets for minimizing liability. Informed consent was the most reported entity in these malpractice suits. This finding emphasizes the importance of open communication between physicians and their patients regarding expectations as well as documentation of specific risks, benefits, and alternatives.","Svider, PF; Keeley, BR; Zumba, O; Mauro, AC; Setzen, M; Eloy, JA",2013,"LARYNGOSCOPE"

"Young without plastic surgery: Perceptual adaptation to the age of female and male faces","Adaptation influences perception not only of simple stimulus qualities such as motion or colour, but also of complex stimuli such as faces. Here we demonstrate contrastive aftereffects of adaptation to facial age. In Experiment 1, participants adapted to either young or old faces, and subsequently estimated the age of morphed test faces with interpolated ages of 30, 40, 50 or 60 years. Following adaptation to old adaptors, test faces were classified as much younger when compared to classifications of the same test faces following adaptation to young faces, which in turn caused subjective test face ""aging"". These aftereffects were reduced but remained clear even when facial gender changed between adaptor and test faces. In Experiment 2, we induced simultaneous opposite age aftereffects for female and male faces. Overall, these results demonstrate interactions in the perception of facial age and gender, and support dissociable neuronal coding of male and female faces. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The patients who received wound infection prophylaxis had 5.1 percent infections compared with 20.5 percent in the placebo group (p = 0.00009). Eighty percent of all wound infections were first seen after discharge, explaining why plastic surgeons might overlook their infectious complications. There was a significant reduction in postoperative complications (p = 0.04) and in the additional use of antibiotics postoperatively (p = 0.007) in the prophylaxis group. Subgroup analysis showed a significant reduction in surgical infections in breast surgery (p < 0.05) and reconstructive surgery with naps (p < 0.05). No effect of the prophylactic regime was demonstrated in patients undergoing secondary surgery for cleft lip and palate disease.","AMLAND, PF; ANDENAES, K; SAMDAL, F; LINGAAS, E; SANDSMARK, M; ABYHOLM, F; GIERCKSKY, KE",1995,"PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY"

"Evidence-Based Use of Pulsed Electromagnetic Field Therapy in Clinical Plastic Surgery","Background: The initial development of pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) therapy and its evolution over the last century for use in clinical surgery has been slow, primarily because of lack of scientifically-derived, evidence-based knowledge of the mechanism of action. Objective: Our objective was to review the major scientific breakthroughs and current understanding of the mechanism of action of PEMF therapy, providing clinicians with a sound basis for optimal use. Methods: A literature review was conducted, including mechanism of action and biologic and clinical studies of PEMF. Using case illustrations, a holistic exposition on the clinical use of PEMF in plastic surgery was performed. Results: PEMF therapy has been used successfully in the management of postsurgical pain and edema, the treatment of chronic wounds, and in facilitating vasodilatation and angiogenesis. Using scientific support, the authors present the currently accepted mechanism of action of PEMF therapy. Conclusions: This review shows that plastic surgeons have at hand a powerful tool with no known side effects for the adjunctive, noninvasive, nonpharmacologic management of postoperative pain and edema. Given the recent rapid advances in development of portable and economical PEMF devices, what has been of most significance to the plastic surgeon is the laboratory and clinical confirmation of decreased pain and swelling following injury or surgery.

"Transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells is an optimal approach for plastic surgery","Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are able to differentiate into a variety of cell types, offering promising approaches for stem cell-mediated tissue regeneration. Here, we explored the potential of utilizing MSCs to reconstruct orofacial tissue, thereby altering the orofacial appearance. We demonstrated that bone marrow MSCs were capable of generating bone structures and bone-associated marrow elements on the surfaces of the orofacial bone. This resulted in significant recontouring of the facial appearance in mouse and swine. Notably, the newly formed bone and associated marrow tissues integrated with the surfaces of the recipient bones and re-established a functional bone marrow organ-like system. These data suggested that MSC-mediated tissue regeneration led to a body structure extension, with the re-establishment of all functional components necessary for maintaining the bone and associated marrow organ. In addition, we found that the subcutaneous transplantation of another population of MSCs, the human periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs), could form substantial amounts of collagen fibers and improve facial wrinkles in mouse. By contrast, bone marrow MSCs failed to survive at 8 weeks post-transplantation under the conditions used for the PDLSC transplantation. This study suggested that the mutual interactions between donor MSCs and recipient microenvironment determine long-term outcome of the functional tissue regeneration.","Fang, DJ; Seo, BM; Liu, Y; Sonoyama, W; Yamaza, T; Zhang, CM; Wang, S; Shi, ST",2007,"STEM CELLS"
"Plastic Surgery-Related Hashtag Utilization on Instagram: Implications for Education and Marketing","Background: Recent data suggest patients are seeking aesthetic surgery to improve their appearance on Instagram and other social media. Despite the rising influence of Instagram in plastic surgery, few academic publications address Instagram, let alone evaluate its utilization in plastic surgery. Objectives: We set out to answer the following three questions: 1) what plastic surgery-related content is being posted to Instagram; 2) who is posting this content; and 3) what specific hashtags are they using? Methods: Our study queried 21 Instagram plastic surgery-related hashtags. Content analysis was used to qualitatively evaluate each of the nine ""top"" posts associated with each hashtag (189 posts). Duplicate posts and those not relevant to plastic surgery were excluded. Results: A total of 1,789,270 posts utilized the 21 hashtags sampled in this study. Of the top 189 posts for these 21 queried hashtags, 163 posts met inclusion criteria. Plastic surgeons eligible for membership in American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (ASAPS) accounted for only 17.8% of top posts, whereas noneligible physicians accounted for 26.4%. All nonplastic surgery trained physicians marketed themselves as ""cosmetic surgeons."" Nine top posts (5.5%) were by nonphysicians, including dentists, spas with no associated physician, and a hair salon. The majority of these posts were self-promotional (67.1%) as opposed to educational (32.9%). Board-certified plastic surgeons were significantly more likely to post educational content to Instagram as compared to nonplastic surgeons (62.1% vs 38.1%, P = 0.02). Conclusions: ASAPS eligible board-certified plastic surgeons are underrepresented amongst physicians posting top plastic surgery-related content to Instagram.","Dorfman, RG; Vaca, EE; Mahmood, E; Fine, NA; Schierle, CF",2018,"AESTHETIC SURGERY JOURNAL"

"Systematic Review of Periodontal Plastic Surgery in the Treatment of Multiple Recession-Type Defects","Objectives: The objectives of this systematic review were (1) to evaluate results obtained with different periodontal plastic surgery procedures in the treatment of multiple recession-type defects and (2) to assess differences in results from randomized controlled trials and other types of studies (i.e., controlled clinical trials and case series). Materials and Methods: The MEDLINE, EMBASE and CENTRAL databases were searched up to June 2008 to identify randomized controlled trials, controlled clinical trials and case series with a follow-up period of at least 6 months for patients with multiple recession-type defects who were treated with periodontal plastic surgery. Results: Of 632 articles initially retrieved, only 16 were deemed suitable for more detailed analysis. Of these, only 4 case series met the inclusion criteria. Mean recession and clinical attachment level decreased substantially from baseline to final examination, and probing depth also declined. Mean width of keratinized tissue increased. Mean root coverage ranged from 94% to 98% over the 4 studies, and complete root coverage was achieved for 68% to 90% of patients in the 3 trials for which this variable was reported. Conclusions: Analysis of the limited information available in the dental literature showed improvements in clinical parameters with all of the periodontal plastic surgery procedures. Randomized controlled trials are needed to identify the indications for each surgical technique and any prognostic factors.","Chambrone, L; Lima, LA; Pustiglioni, FE; Chambrone, LA",2009,"JOURNAL OF THE CANADIAN DENTAL ASSOCIATION"
"A globally coherent fingerprint of climate change impacts across natural systems","Causal attribution of recent biological trends to climate change is complicated because non-climatic influences dominate local, short-term biological changes. Any underlying signal from climate change is likely to be revealed by analyses that seek systematic trends across diverse species and geographic regions; however, debates within the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reveal several definitions of a 'systematic trend'. Here, we explore these differences, apply diverse analyses to more than 1,700 species, and show that recent biological trends match climate change predictions. Global meta-analyses documented significant range shifts averaging 6.1 km per decade towards the poles ( or metres per decade upward), and significant mean advancement of spring events by 2.3 days per decade. We define a diagnostic fingerprint of temporal and spatial 'sign-switching' responses uniquely predicted by twentieth century climate trends. Among appropriate long-term/large-scale/multi-species data sets, this diagnostic fingerprint was found for 279 species. This suite of analyses generates 'very high confidence' (as laid down by the IPCC) that climate change is already affecting living systems.","Parmesan, C; Yohe, G",2003,"NATURE"
"Ecological responses to recent climate change","There is now ample evidence of the ecological impacts of recent climate change, from polar terrestrial to tropical marine environments. The responses of both flora and fauna span an array of ecosystems and organizational hierarchies, from the species to the community levels. Despite continued uncertainty as to community and ecosystem trajectories under global change, our review exposes a coherent pattern of ecological change across systems. Although we are only at an early stage in the projected trends of global warming, ecological responses to recent climate change are already clearly visible.","Walther, GR; Post, E; Convey, P; Menzel, A; Parmesan, C; Beebee, TJC; Fromentin, JM; Hoegh-Guldberg, O; Bairlein, F",2002,"NATURE"
"Ecological and evolutionary responses to recent climate change","Ecological changes in the phenology and distribution of plants and animals are occurring in all well-studied marine, freshwater, and terrestrial groups. These observed changes are heavily biased in the directions predicted from global warming and have been linked to local or regional climate change through correlations between climate and biological variation, field and laboratory experiments, and physiological research. Range-restricted species, particularly polar and mountain top species, show severe range contractions and have been the first groups in which entire species have gone extinct due to recent climate change. Tropical coral reefs and amphibians have been most negatively affected. Predator-prey and plant-insect interactions have been disrupted when interacting species have responded differently to warming. Evolutionary adaptations to warmer conditions have occurred in the interiors of species' ranges, and resource use and dispersal have evolved rapidly at expanding range margins. Observed genetic shifts modulate local effects of climate change, but there is little evidence that they will mitigate negative effects at the species level.","Parmesan, C",2006,"ANNUAL REVIEW OF ECOLOGY EVOLUTION AND SYSTEMATICS"
"Extinction risk from climate change","Climate change over the past similar to30 years has produced numerous shifts in the distributions and abundances of species(1,2) and has been implicated in one species-level extinction(3). Using projections of species' distributions for future climate scenarios, we assess extinction risks for sample regions that cover some 20% of the Earth's terrestrial surface. Exploring three approaches in which the estimated probability of extinction shows a powerlaw relationship with geographical range size, we predict, on the basis of mid-range climate-warming scenarios for 2050, that 15 - 37% of species in our sample of regions and taxa will be 'committed to extinction'. When the average of the three methods and two dispersal scenarios is taken, minimal climate-warming scenarios produce lower projections of species committed to extinction (similar to18%) than mid-range (similar to24%) and maximum-change (similar to35%) scenarios. These estimates show the importance of rapid implementation of technologies to decrease greenhouse gas emissions and strategies for carbon sequestration.","Thomas, CD; Cameron, A; Green, RE; Bakkenes, M; Beaumont, LJ; Collingham, YC; Erasmus, BFN; de Siqueira, MF; Grainger, A; Hannah, L; Hughes, L; Huntley, B; van Jaarsveld, AS; Midgley, GF; Miles, L; Ortega-Huerta, MA; Peterson, AT; Phillips, OL; Williams, SE",2004,"NATURE"

"A global overview of drought and heat-induced tree mortality reveals emerging climate change risks for forests","Greenhouse gas emissions have significantly altered global climate, and will continue to do so in the future. Increases in the frequency, duration, and/or severity of drought and heat stress associated with climate change could fundamentally alter the composition, structure, and biogeography of forests in many regions. Of particular concern are potential increases in tree mortality associated with climate-induced physiological stress and interactions with other climate-mediated processes such as insect outbreaks and wildfire. Despite this risk, existing projections of tree mortality are based on models that lack functionally realistic mortality mechanisms, and there has been no attempt to track observations of climate-driven tree mortality globally. Here we present the first global assessment of recent tree mortality attributed to drought and heat stress. Although episodic mortality occurs in the absence of climate change, studies compiled here suggest that at least some of the world's forested ecosystems already may be responding to climate change and raise concern that forests may become increasingly vulnerable to higher background tree mortality rates and die-off in response to future warming and drought, even in environments that are not normally considered water-limited. This further suggests risks to ecosystem services, including the loss of sequestered forest carbon and associated atmospheric feedbacks. Our review also identifies key information gaps and scientific uncertainties that currently hinder our ability to predict tree mortality in response to climate change and emphasizes the need for a globally coordinated observation system. Overall, our review reveals the potential for amplified tree mortality due to drought and heat in forests worldwide.

"The next generation of scenarios for climate change research and assessment","Advances in the science and observation of climate change are providing a clearer understanding of the inherent variability of Earth's climate system and its likely response to human and natural influences. The implications of climate change for the environment and society will depend not only on the response of the Earth system to changes in radiative forcings, but also on how humankind responds through changes in technology, economies, lifestyle and policy. Extensive uncertainties exist in future forcings of and responses to climate change, necessitating the use of scenarios of the future to explore the potential consequences of different response options. To date, such scenarios have not adequately examined crucial possibilities, such as climate change mitigation and adaptation, and have relied on research processes that slowed the exchange of information among physical, biological and social scientists. Here we describe a new process for creating plausible scenarios to investigate some of the most challenging and important questions about climate change confronting the global community.","Moss, RH; Edmonds, JA; Hibbard, KA; Manning, MR; Rose, SK; van Vuuren, DP; Carter, TR; Emori, S; Kainuma, M; Kram, T; Meehl, GA; Mitchell, JFB; Nakicenovic, N; Riahi, K; Smith, SJ; Stouffer, RJ; Thomson, AM; Weyant, JP; Wilbanks, TJ",2010,"NATURE"
"Temperature sensitivity of soil carbon decomposition and feedbacks to climate change","Significantly more carbon is stored in the world's soils-including peatlands, wetlands and permafrost-than is present in the atmosphere. Disagreement exists, however, regarding the effects of climate change on global soil carbon stocks. If carbon stored belowground is transferred to the atmosphere by a warming-induced acceleration of its decomposition, a positive feedback to climate change would occur. Conversely, if increases of plant-derived carbon inputs to soils exceed increases in decomposition, the feedback would be negative. Despite much research, a consensus has not yet emerged on the temperature sensitivity of soil carbon decomposition. Unravelling the feedback effect is particularly difficult, because the diverse soil organic compounds exhibit a wide range of kinetic properties, which determine the intrinsic temperature sensitivity of their decomposition. Moreover, several environmental constraints obscure the intrinsic temperature sensitivity of substrate decomposition, causing lower observed 'apparent' temperature sensitivity, and these constraints may, themselves, be sensitive to climate.","Davidson, EA; Janssens, IA",2006,"NATURE"
"Soil carbon sequestration impacts on global climate change and food security","The carbon sink capacity of the world's agricultural and degraded soils is 50 to 66% of the historic carbon loss of 42 to 78 gigatons of carbon. The rate of soil organic carbon sequestration with adoption of recommended technologies depends on soil texture and structure, rainfall, temperature, farming system, and soil management. Strategies to increase the soil carbon pool include soil restoration and woodland regeneration, no-till farming, cover crops, nutrient management, manuring and sludge application, improved grazing, water conservation and harvesting, efficient irrigation, agroforestry practices, and growing energy crops on spare lands. An increase of 1 ton of soil carbon pool of degraded cropland soils may increase crop yield by 20 to 40 kilograms per hectare (kg/ha) for wheat, 10 to 20 kg/ha for maize, and 0.5 to 1 kg/ha for cowpeas. As well as enhancing food security, carbon sequestration has the potential to offset fossil-fuel emissions by 0.4 to 1.2 gigatons of carbon per year, or 5 to 15% of the global fossil-fuel emissions.","Lal, R",2004,"SCIENCE"
"Coral reefs under rapid climate change and ocean acidification","Atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration is expected to exceed 500 parts per million and global temperatures to rise by at least 2 degrees C by 2050 to 2100, values that significantly exceed those of at least the past 420,000 years during which most extant marine organisms evolved. Under conditions expected in the 21st century, global warming and ocean acidification will compromise carbonate accretion, with corals becoming increasingly rare on reef systems. The result will be less diverse reef communities and carbonate reef structures that fail to be maintained. Climate change also exacerbates local stresses from declining water quality and overexploitation of key species, driving reefs increasingly toward the tipping point for functional collapse. This review presents future scenarios for coral reefs that predict increasingly serious consequences for reef- associated fisheries, tourism, coastal protection, and people. As the International Year of the Reef 2008 begins, scaled- up management intervention and decisive action on global emissions are required if the loss of coral- dominated ecosystems is to be avoided.","Hoegh-Guldberg, O; Mumby, PJ; Hooten, AJ; Steneck, RS; Greenfield, P; Gomez, E; Harvell, CD; Sale, PF; Edwards, AJ; Caldeira, K; Knowlton, N; Eakin, CM; Iglesias-Prieto, R; Muthiga, N; Bradbury, RH; Dubi, A; Hatziolos, ME",2007,"SCIENCE"
"Forests and climate change: Forcings, feedbacks, and the climate benefits of forests","The world's forests influence climate through physical, chemical, and biological processes that affect planetary energetics, the hydrologic cycle, and atmospheric composition. These complex and nonlinear forest-atmosphere interactions can dampen or amplify anthropogenic climate change. Tropical, temperate, and boreal reforestation and afforestation attenuate global warming through carbon sequestration. Biogeophysical feedbacks can enhance or diminish this negative climate forcing. Tropical forests mitigate warming through evaporative cooling, but the low albedo of boreal forests is a positive climate forcing. The evaporative effect of temperate forests is unclear. The net climate forcing from these and other processes is not known. Forests are under tremendous pressure from global change. Interdisciplinary science that integrates knowledge of the many interacting climate services of forests with the impacts of global change is necessary to identify and understand as yet unexplored feedbacks in the Earth system and the potential of forests to mitigate climate change.","Bonan, GB",2008,"SCIENCE"

"Predicting the impacts of climate change on the distribution of species: are bioclimate envelope models useful?","Modelling strategies for predicting the potential impacts of climate change on the natural distribution of species have often focused on the characterization of a species' bioclimate envelope. A number of recent critiques have questioned the validity of this approach by pointing to the many factors other than climate that play an important part in determining species distributions and the dynamics of distribution changes. Such factors include biotic interactions, evolutionary change and dispersal ability. This paper reviews and evaluates criticisms of bioclimate envelope models and discusses the implications of these criticisms for the different modelling strategies employed. It is proposed that, although the complexity of the natural system presents fundamental limits to predictive modelling, the bioclimate envelope approach can provide a useful first approximation as to the potentially dramatic impact of climate change on biodiversity. However, it is stressed that the spatial scale at which these models are applied is of fundamental importance, and that model results should not be interpreted without due consideration of the limitations involved. A hierarchical modelling framework is proposed through which some of these limitations can be addressed within a broader, scale-dependent context.","Pearson, RG; Dawson, TP",2003,"GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY"

Projected increases in carbon dioxide and temperature over the next 50 years exceed the conditions under which coral reefs have flourished over the past half-million years. However, reefs will change rather than disappear entirely, with some species already showing far greater tolerance to climate change and coral bleaching than others.

"Climate change, coral bleaching and the future of the world's coral reefs","Sea temperatures in many tropical regions have increased by almost 1 degrees C over the past 100 years, and are currently increasing at similar to 1-2 degrees C per century. Coral bleaching occurs when the thermal tolerance of corals and their photosynthetic symbionts (zooxanthellae) is exceeded. Mass coral bleaching has occurred in association with episodes of elevated sea temperatures over the past 20 years and involves the loss of the zooxanthellae following chronic photoinhibition. Mass bleaching has resulted in significant losses of live coral in many parts of the world. This paper considers the biochemical, physiological and ecological perspectives of coral bleaching. It also uses the outputs of four runs from three models of global climate change which simulate changes in sea temperature and hence how the frequency and intensity of bleaching events will change over the next 100 years. The results suggest that the thermal tolerances of reef-building corals are likely to be exceeded every year within the next few decades. Events as severe as the 1998 event, the worst on record, are likely to become commonplace within 20 years. Most information suggests that the capacity for acclimation by corals has already been exceeded, and that adaptation will be too slow to avert a decline in the quality of the world's reefs. The rapidity of the changes that are predicted indicates a major problem for tropical marine ecosystems and suggests that unrestrained warming cannot occur without the loss and degradation of coral reefs on a global scale.","Hoegh-Guldberg, O",1999,"MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH"
"The WCRP CMIP3 multimodel dataset - A new era in climate change research","A coordinated set of global coupled climate model [atmosphere ocean general circulation model (AOGCM)] experiments for twentieth- and twenty-first- century climate, as well as several climate change commitment and other experiments, was run by 16 modeling groups from 11 countries with 23 models for assessment in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change-(IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4). Since the assessment was completed, output from another model has been added to the dataset, so the participation is now 17 groups from 12 countries with 24 models. This effort, as well as the subsequent analysis phase, was organized by the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) Climate Variability and Predictability (CLIVAR) Working Group on Coupled Models (WGCM) Climate Simulation Panel, and constitutes the third phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP3). The dataset is called the WCRP CMIP3 multimodel dataset, and represents the largest and most comprehensive international global coupled climate model experiment and multimodel analysis effort ever attempted. As of March 2007, the Program for Climate Model Diagnostics and Intercomparison (PCMDI) has collected, archived, and served roughly 32 TB of model data. With oversight from the panel, the multimodel data were made openly available from PCMDI for analysis and academic applications. Over 171 TB of data had been downloaded among the more than 1000 registered users to date. Over 200 journal articles, based in part on the dataset, have been published 23 as so far. Though initially aimed at the IPCC AR4, this unique and valuable resource will continue to be maintained for at least the next several years. Never before has such` an extensive set of climate model simulations been made available to the international climate science community for study. The ready access to the multimodel dataset opens up these types of model analyses to researchers, including students, who previously could not obtain state-of-the-art climate model output, and thus represents a new era in climate change research. As a direct consequence, these ongoing studies are increasing the body of knowledge regarding our understanding of how the climate system currently works, and how it may change in the future.

"European phenological response to climate change matches the warming pattern","Global climate change impacts can already be tracked in many physical and biological systems; in particular, terrestrial ecosystems provide a consistent picture of observed changes. One of the preferred indicators is phenology, the science of natural recurring events, as their recorded dates provide a high-temporal resolution of ongoing changes. Thus, numerous analyses have demonstrated an earlier onset of spring events for mid and higher latitudes and a lengthening of the growing season. However, published single-site or single-species studies are particularly open to suspicion of being biased towards predominantly reporting climate change-induced impacts. No comprehensive study or meta-analysis has so far examined the possible lack of evidence for changes or shifts at sites where no temperature change is observed. We used an enormous systematic phenological network data set of more than 125 000 observational series of 542 plant and 19 animal species in 21 European countries (1971-2000). Our results showed that 78% of all leafing, flowering and fruiting records advanced (30% significantly) and only 3% were significantly delayed, whereas the signal of leaf colouring/fall is ambiguous. We conclude that previously published results of phenological changes were not biased by reporting or publication predisposition: the average advance of spring/summer was 2.5 days decade(-1) in Europe. Our analysis of 254 mean national time series undoubtedly demonstrates that species' phenology is responsive to temperature of the preceding months (mean advance of spring/summer by 2.5 days degrees C-1, delay of leaf colouring and fall by 1.0 day degrees C-1). The pattern of observed change in spring efficiently matches measured national warming across 19 European countries (correlation coefficient r=-0.69, P < 0.001).","Menzel, A; Sparks, TH; Estrella, N; Koch, E; Aasa, A; Ahas, R; Alm-Kubler, K; Bissolli, P; Braslavska, O; Briede, A; Chmielewski, FM; Crepinsek, Z; Curnel, Y; Dahl, A; Defila, C; Donnelly, A; Filella, Y; Jatcza, K; Mage, F; Mestre, A; Nordli, O; Penuelas, J; Pirinen, P; Remisova, V; Scheifinger, H; Striz, M; Susnik, A; Van Vliet, AJH; Wielgolaski, FE; Zach, S; Zust, A",2006,"GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY"

For species with northerly or southerly range margins in the North Sea, half have shown boundary shifts with warming, and all but one shifted northward. Species with shifting distributions have faster life cycles and smaller body sizes than nonshifting species. Further temperature rises are likely to have profound impacts on commercial fisheries through continued shifts in distribution and alterations in community interactions.","Perry, AL; Low, PJ; Ellis, JR; Reynolds, JD",2005,"SCIENCE"
"The impacts of climate change on water resources and agriculture in China","China is the world's most populous country and a major emitter of greenhouse gases. Consequently, much research has focused on China's influence on climate change but somewhat less has been written about the impact of climate change on China. China experienced explosive economic growth in recent decades, but with only 7% of the world's arable land available to feed 22% of the world's population, China's economy may be vulnerable to climate change itself. We find, however, that notwithstanding the clear warming that has occurred in China in recent decades, current understanding does not allow a clear assessment of the impact of anthropogenic climate change on China's water resources and agriculture and therefore China's ability to feed its people. To reach a more definitive conclusion, future work must improve regional climate simulations-especially of precipitation-and develop a better understanding of the managed and unmanaged responses of crops to changes in climate, diseases, pests and atmospheric constituents.","Piao, SL; Ciais, P; Huang, Y; Shen, ZH; Peng, SS; Li, JS; Zhou, LP; Liu, HY; Ma, YC; Ding, YH; Friedlingstein, P; Liu, CZ; Tan, K; Yu, YQ; Zhang, TY; Fang, JY",2010,"NATURE"

Here, we show that meltwater is extremely important in the Indus basin and important for the Brahmaputra basin, but plays only a modest role for the Ganges, Yangtze, and Yellow rivers. A huge difference also exists between basins in the extent to which climate change is predicted to affect water availability and food security.

This drying is due to increased anticyclonic circulation that yields increasingly stable conditions and is associated with a northward shift of the Atlantic storm track. A pronounced warming is also projected, maximum in the summer season. Inter-annual variability is projected to mostly increase especially in summer, which, along with the mean Warming, would lead to a greater occurrence of extremely high temperature events. The projections by the global and regional model Simulations are generally consistent with each other at the broad scale. However, the precipitation change signal produced by the regional models shows Substantial orographically-induced fine Scale Structure absent in the global models. Overall, these Change Signals are robust across forcing scenarios and future time periods, with the magnitude of the signal increasing with the intensity of the forcing. The intensity and robustness of the climate change signals produced by a range of global and regional climate models suggest that the Mediterranean might be an especially Vulnerable region to global change.

"Tropical cyclones and climate change","Whether the characteristics of tropical cyclones have changed or will change in a warming climate - and if so, how - has been the subject of considerable investigation, often with conflicting results. Large amplitude fluctuations in the frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones greatly complicate both the detection of long-term trends and their attribution to rising levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases. Trend detection is further impeded by substantial limitations in the availability and quality of global historical records of tropical cyclones. Therefore, it remains uncertain whether past changes in tropical cyclone activity have exceeded the variability expected from natural causes. However, future projections based on theory and high-resolution dynamical models consistently indicate that greenhouse warming will cause the globally averaged intensity of tropical cyclones to shift towards stronger storms, with intensity increases of 2-11% by 2100. Existing modelling studies also consistently project decreases in the globally averaged frequency of tropical cyclones, by 6-34%. Balanced against this, higher resolution modelling studies typically project substantial increases in the frequency of the most intense cyclones, and increases of the order of 20% in the precipitation rate within 100 km of the storm centre. For all cyclone parameters, projected changes for individual basins show large variations between different modelling studies.","Knutson, TR; McBride, JL; Chan, J; Emanuel, K; Holland, G; Landsea, C; Held, I; Kossin, JP; Srivastava, AK; Sugi, M",2010,"NATURE GEOSCIENCE"
"Impacts of climate change on the future of biodiversity","Many studies in recent years have investigated the effects of climate change on the future of biodiversity. In this review, we first examine the different possible effects of climate change that can operate at individual, population, species, community, ecosystem and biome scales, notably showing that species can respond to climate change challenges by shifting their climatic niche along three non-exclusive axes: time (e.g. phenology), space (e.g. range) and self (e.g. physiology). Then, we present the principal specificities and caveats of the most common approaches used to estimate future biodiversity at global and sub-continental scales and we synthesise their results. Finally, we highlight several challenges for future research both in theoretical and applied realms. Overall, our review shows that current estimates are very variable, depending on the method, taxonomic group, biodiversity loss metrics, spatial scales and time periods considered. Yet, the majority of models indicate alarming consequences for biodiversity, with the worst-case scenarios leading to extinction rates that would qualify as the sixth mass extinction in the history of the earth.","Bellard, C; Bertelsmeier, C; Leadley, P; Thuiller, W; Courchamp, F",2012,"ECOLOGY LETTERS"
"Soil carbon sequestration to mitigate climate change","The increase in atmospheric concentration of CO2 by 31% since 1750 from fossil fuel combustion and land use change necessitates identification of strategies for mitigating the threat of the attendant global warming. Since the industrial revolution, global emissions of carbon (C) are estimated at 270 +/- 30 Pg (Pg = petagram = 10(15) g = 1 billion ton) due to fossil fuel combustion and 136 55 Pg due to land use change and soil cultivation. Emissions due to land use change include those by deforestation, biomass burning, conversion of natural to agricultural ecosystems, drainage of wetlands and soil cultivation. Depletion of soil organic C (SOC) pool have contributed 78 +/- 12 Pg of C to the atmosphere. Some cultivated soils have lost one-half to two-thirds of the original SOC pool with a cumulative loss of 30-40 Mg C/ha (Mg = megagram = 106 g = 1 ton). The depletion of soil C is accentuated by soil degradation and exacerbated by land misuse and soil mismanagement. Thus, adoption of a restorative land use and recommended management practices (RMPs) on agricultural soils can reduce the rate of enrichment of atmospheric CO2 while having positive impacts on food security, agro-industries, water quality and the environment. A considerable part of the depleted SOC pool can be restored through conversion of marginal lands into restorative land uses, adoption of conservation tillage with cover crops and crop residue mulch, nutrient cycling including the use of compost and manure, and other systems of sustainable management of soil and water resources. Measured rates of soil C sequestration through adoption of RMPs range from 50 to 1000 kg/ha/year. The global potential of SOC sequestration through these practices is 0.9 +/- 0.3 Pg C/year, which may offset one-fourth to one-third of the annual increase in atmospheric CO2 estimated at 3.3 Pg C/year. The cumulative potential of soil C sequestration over 25-50 years is 30-60 Pg. The soil C sequestration is a truly win-win strategy. It restores degraded soils, enhances biomass production, purifies surface and ground waters, and reduces the rate of enrichment of atmospheric CO2 by offsetting emissions due to fossil fuel.

"Climate change and evolutionary adaptation","Evolutionary adaptation can be rapid and potentially help species counter stressful conditions or realize ecological opportunities arising from climate change. The challenges are to understand when evolution will occur and to identify potential evolutionary winners as well as losers, such as species lacking adaptive capacity living near physiological limits. Evolutionary processes also need to be incorporated into management programmes designed to minimize biodiversity loss under rapid climate change. These challenges can be met through realistic models of evolutionary change linked to experimental data across a range of taxa.","Hoffmann, AA; Sgro, CM",2011,"NATURE"

"Impact of regional climate change on human health","The World Health Organisation estimates that the warming and precipitation trends due to anthropogenic climate change of the past 30 years already claim over 150,000 lives annually. Many prevalent human diseases are linked to climate fluctuations, from cardiovascular mortality and respiratory illnesses due to heatwaves, to altered transmission of infectious diseases and malnutrition from crop failures. Uncertainty remains in attributing the expansion or resurgence of diseases to climate change, owing to lack of long-term, high-quality data sets as well as the large influence of socio-economic factors and changes in immunity and drug resistance. Here we review the growing evidence that climate-health relationships pose increasing health risks under future projections of climate change and that the warming trend over recent decades has already contributed to increased morbidity and mortality in many regions of the world. Potentially vulnerable regions include the temperate latitudes, which are projected to warm disproportionately, the regions around the Pacific and Indian oceans that are currently subjected to large rainfall variability due to the El Nino/Southern Oscillation sub-Saharan Africa and sprawling cities where the urban heat island effect could intensify extreme climatic events.","Patz, JA; Campbell-Lendrum, D; Holloway, T; Foley, JA",2005,"NATURE"

"Prioritizing climate change adaptation needs for food security in 2030","Investments aimed at improving agricultural adaptation to climate change inevitably favor some crops and regions over others. An analysis of climate risks for crops in 12 food- insecure regions was conducted to identify adaptation priorities, based on statistical crop models and climate projections for 2030 from 20 general circulation models. Results indicate South Asia and Southern Africa as two regions that, without sufficient adaptation measures, will likely suffer negative impacts on several crops that are important to large food- insecure human populations. We also find that uncertainties vary widely by crop, and therefore priorities will depend on the risk attitudes of investment institutions.","Lobell, DB; Burke, MB; Tebaldi, C; Mastrandrea, MD; Falcon, WP; Naylor, RL",2008,"SCIENCE"
"The impacts of climate change in coastal marine systems","Anthropogenically induced global climate change has profound implications for marine ecosystems and the economic and social systems that depend upon them. The relationship between temperature and individual performance is reasonably well understood, and much climate-related research has focused on potential shifts in distribution and abundance driven directly by temperature. However, recent work has revealed that both abiotic changes and biological responses in the ocean will be substantially more complex. For example, changes in ocean chemistry may be more important than changes in temperature for the performance and survival of many organisms. Ocean circulation, which drives larval transport, will also change, with important consequences for population dynamics. Furthermore, climatic impacts on one or a few 'leverage species' may result in sweeping community-level changes. Finally, synergistic effects between climate and other anthropogenic variables, particularly fishing pressure, will likely exacerbate climate-induced changes. Efforts to manage and conserve living marine systems in the face of climate change will require improvements to the existing predictive framework. Key directions for future research include identifying key demographic transitions that influence population dynamics, predicting changes in the community-level impacts of ecologically dominant species, incorporating populations' ability to evolve (adapt), and understanding the scales over which climate will change and living systems will respond.","Harley, CDG; Hughes, AR; Hultgren, KM; Miner, BG; Sorte, CJB; Thornber, CS; Rodriguez, LF; Tomanek, L; Williams, SL",2006,"ECOLOGY LETTERS"
"The Impact of Climate Change on the World's Marine Ecosystems","Marine ecosystems are centrally important to the biology of the planet, yet a comprehensive understanding of how anthropogenic climate change is affecting them has been poorly developed. Recent studies indicate that rapidly rising greenhouse gas concentrations are driving ocean systems toward conditions not seen for millions of years, with an associated risk of fundamental and irreversible ecological transformation. The impacts of anthropogenic climate change so far include decreased ocean productivity, altered food web dynamics, reduced abundance of habitat-forming species, shifting species distributions, and a greater incidence of disease. Although there is considerable uncertainty about the spatial and temporal details, climate change is clearly and fundamentally altering ocean ecosystems. Further change will continue to create enormous challenges and costs for societies worldwide, particularly those in developing countries.","Hoegh-Guldberg, O; Bruno, JF",2010,"SCIENCE"

"Climate change threats to plant diversity in Europe","Climate change has already triggered species distribution shifts in many parts of the world. Increasing impacts are expected for the future, yet few studies have aimed for a general understanding of the regional basis for species vulnerability. We projected late 21st century distributions for 1,350 European plants species under seven climate change scenarios. Application of the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources Red List criteria to our projections shows that many European plant species could become severely threatened. More than half of the species we studied could be vulnerable or threatened by 2080. Expected species loss and turnover per pixel proved to be highly variable across scenarios (27-42% and 45-63% respectively, averaged over Europe) and across regions (2.5-86% and 17-86%, averaged over scenarios). Modeled species loss and turnover were found to depend strongly on the degree of change in just two climate variables describing temperature and moisture conditions. Despite the coarse scale of the analysis, species from mountains could be seen to be disproportionably sensitive to climate change (approximate to 60% species loss). The boreal region was projected to lose few species, although gaining many others from immigration. The greatest changes are expected in the transition between the Mediterranean and Euro-Siberian regions. We found that risks of extinction for European plants may be large, even in moderate scenarios of climate change and despite inter-model variability.","Thuiller, W; Lavorel, S; Araujo, MB; Sykes, MT; Prentice, IC",2005,"PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA"
"Successful adaptation to climate change across scales","Climate change impacts and responses are presently observed in physical and ecological systems. Adaptation to these impacts is increasingly being observed in both physical and ecological systems as well as in human adjustments to resource availability and risk at different spatial and societal scales. We review the nature of adaptation and the implications of different spatial scales for these processes. We outline a set of normative evaluative criteria for judging the success of adaptations at different scales. We argue that elements of effectiveness, efficiency, equity and legitimacy are important in judging success in terms of the sustainability of development pathways into an uncertain future. We further argue that each of these elements of decision-making is implicit within presently formulated scenarios of socio-economic futures of both emission trajectories and adaptation, though with different weighting. The process by which adaptations are to be judged at different scales will involve new and challenging institutional processes. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

"Changes in precipitation with climate change","There is a direct influence of global warming on precipitation. Increased heating leads to greater evaporation and thus surface drying, thereby increasing the intensity and duration of drought. However, the water holding capacity of air increases by about 7% per 1 C warming, which leads to increased water vapor in the atmosphere. Hence, storms, whether individual thunderstorms, extratropical rain or snow storms, or tropical cyclones, supplied with increased moisture, produce more intense precipitation events. Such events are observed to be widely occurring, even where total precipitation is decreasing: 'it never rains but it pours!' This increases the risk of flooding. The atmospheric and surface energy budget plays a critical role in the hydrological cycle, and also in the slower rate of change that occurs in total precipitation than total column water vapor. With modest changes in winds, patterns of precipitation do not change much, but result in dry areas becoming drier (generally throughout the subtropics) and wet areas becoming wetter, especially in the mid-to high latitudes: the 'rich get richer and the poor get poorer'. This pattern is simulated by climate models and is projected to continue into the future. Because, with warming, more precipitation occurs as rain instead of snow and snow melts earlier, there is increased runoff and risk of flooding in early spring, but increased risk of drought in summer, especially over continental areas. However, with more precipitation per unit of upward motion in the atmosphere, i.e. 'more bang for the buck', atmospheric circulation weakens, causing monsoons to falter. In the tropics and subtropics, precipitation patterns are dominated by shifts as sea surface temperatures change, with El Nino a good example. The volcanic eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991 led to an unprecedented drop in land precipitation and runoff, and to widespread drought, as precipitation shifted from land to oceans and evaporation faltered, providing lessons for possible geoengineering. Most models simulate precipitation that occurs prematurely and too often, and with insufficient intensity, resulting in recycling that is too large and a lifetime of moisture in the atmosphere that is too short, which affects runoff and soil moisture.","Trenberth, KE",2011,"CLIMATE RESEARCH"
"Irreversible climate change due to carbon dioxide emissions","The severity of damaging human-induced climate change depends not only on the magnitude of the change but also on the potential for irreversibility. This paper shows that the climate change that takes place due to increases in carbon dioxide concentration is largely irreversible for 1,000 years after emissions stop. Following cessation of emissions, removal of atmospheric carbon dioxide decreases radiative forcing, but is largely compensated by slower loss of heat to the ocean, so that atmospheric temperatures do not drop significantly for at least 1,000 years. Among illustrative irreversible impacts that should be expected if atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations increase from current levels near 385 parts per million by volume (ppmv) to a peak of 450-600 ppmv over the coming century are irreversible dry-season rainfall reductions in several regions comparable to those of the ""dust bowl'' era and inexorable sea level rise. Thermal expansion of the warming ocean provides a conservative lower limit to irreversible global average sea level rise of at least 0.4-1.0 m if 21st century CO2 concentrations exceed 600 ppmv and 0.6-1.9 m for peak CO2 concentrations exceeding approximate to 1,000 ppmv. Additional contributions from glaciers and ice sheet contributions to future sea level rise are uncertain but may equal or exceed several meters over the next millennium or longer.","Solomon, S; Plattner, GK; Knutti, R; Friedlingstein, P",2009,"PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA"
"Range shifts and adaptive responses to Quaternary climate change","Tree taxa shifted latitude or elevation range in response to changes in Quaternary climate. Because many modern trees display adaptive differentiation in relation to latitude or elevation, it is likely that ancient trees were also so differentiated, with environmental sensitivities of populations throughout the range evolving in conjunction with migrations. Rapid climate changes challenge this process by imposing stronger selection and by distancing populations from environments to which they are adapted. The unprecedented rates of climate changes anticipated to occur in the future, coupled with land use changes that impede gene flow, can be expected to disrupt the interplay of adaptation and migration, likely affecting productivity and threatening the persistence of many species.","Davis, MB; Shaw, RG",2001,"SCIENCE"
"Herbivory in global climate change research: direct effects of rising temperature on insect herbivores","This review examines the direct effects of climate change on insect herbivores. Temperature is identified as the dominant abiotic factor directly affecting herbivorous insects. There is little evidence of any direct effects Of CO(2) or UVB. Direct impacts of precipitation have been largely neglected in current research on climate change. Temperature directly affects development, survival, range and abundance. Species with a large geographical range will tend to be less affected. The main effect of temperature in temperate regions is to influence winter survival; at more northerly latitudes, higher temperatures extend the summer season, increasing the available thermal budget for growth and reproduction. Photoperiod is the dominant cue for the seasonal synchrony of temperate insects, but their thermal requirements may differ at different times of year. Interactions between photoperiod and temperature determine phenology; the two factors do not necessarily operate in tandem. Insect herbivores show a number of distinct life-history strategies to exploit plants with different growth forms and strategies, which will be differentially affected by climate warming. There are still many challenges facing biologists in predicting and monitoring the impacts of climate change. Future research needs to consider insect herbivore phenotypic and genotypic flexibility, their responses to global change parameters operating in concert, and awareness that some patterns may only become apparent in the longer term.","Bale, JS; Masters, GJ; Hodkinson, ID; Awmack, C; Bezemer, TM; Brown, VK; Butterfield, J; Buse, A; Coulson, JC; Farrar, J; Good, JEG; Harrington, R; Hartley, S; Jones, TH; Lindroth, RL; Press, MC; Symrnioudis, I; Watt, AD; Whittaker, JB",2002,"GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY"
"Global response of terrestrial ecosystem structure and function to CO2 and climate change: results from six dynamic global vegetation models","The possible responses of ecosystem processes to rising atmospheric CO2 concentration and climate change are illustrated using six dynamic global vegetation models that explicitly represent the interactions of ecosystem carbon and water exchanges with vegetation dynamics. The models are driven by the IPCC IS92a scenario of rising CO2 (Wigley et al. 1991), and by climate changes resulting from effective CO2 concentrations corresponding to IS92a, simulated by the coupled ocean atmosphere model HadCM2-SUL. Simulations with changing CO2 alone show a widely distributed terrestrial carbon sink of 1.4-3.8 Pg C y(-1) during the 1990s, rising to 3.7-8.6 Pg C y(-1) a century later. Simulations including climate change show a reduced sink both today (0.6-3.0 Pg C y(-1)) and a century later (0.3-6.6 Pg C y(-1)) as a result of the impacts of climate change on NEP of tropical and southern hemisphere ecosystems. In all models, the rate of increase of NEP begins to level off around 2030 as a consequence of the 'diminishing return' of physiological CO2 effects at high CO2 concentrations. Four out of the six models show a further, climate-induced decline in NEP resulting from increased heterotrophic respiration and declining tropical NPP after 2050. Changes in vegetation structure influence the magnitude and spatial pattern of the carbon sink and, in combination with changing climate, also freshwater availability (runoff). It is shown that these changes, once set in motion, would continue to evolve for at least a century even if atmospheric CO2 concentration and climate could be instantaneously stabilized. The results should be considered illustrative in the sense that the choice of CO2 concentration scenario was arbitrary and only one climate model scenario was used. However, the results serve to indicate a range of possible biospheric responses to CO2 and climate change. They reveal major uncertainties about the response of NEP to climate change resulting, primarily, from differences in the way that modelled global NPP responds to a changing climate. The simulations illustrate, however, that the magnitude of possible biospheric influences on the carbon balance requires that this factor is taken into account for future scenarios of atmospheric CO2 and climate change.","Cramer, W; Bondeau, A; Woodward, FI; Prentice, IC; Betts, RA; Brovkin, V; Cox, PM; Fisher, V; Foley, JA; Friend, AD; Kucharik, C; Lomas, MR; Ramankutty, N; Sitch, S; Smith, B; White, A; Young-Molling, C",2001,"GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY"
"Linking climate change modelling to impacts studies: recent advances in downscaling techniques for hydrological modelling","There is now a large published literature on the strengths and weaknesses of downscaling methods for different climatic variables, in different regions and seasons. However, little attention is given to the choice of downscaling method when examining the impacts of climate change on hydrological systems. This review paper assesses the current downscalling literature, examining new developments in the downscaling field specifically for hydrological impacts. Sections focus on the downscaling concept; new methods; comparative methodological studies; the modelling of extremes; and the application to hydrological impacts. Consideration is then given to new developments in climate scenario construction which may offer the most potential for advancement within the 'downscaling for hydrological impacts' community, such as probabilistic modelling, pattern scaling and downscaling of multiple variables and suggests ways that they can be merged with downscaling techniques in a probabilistic climate change scenario framework to assess the uncertainties associated with future projections. Within hydrological impact studies there is still little consideration given to applied research; how the results can be best used to enable stakeholders and managers to make informed, robust decisions on adaptation and mitigation strategies in the face of many uncertainties about the future. It is suggested that there is a need for a move away from comparison studies into the provision of decision-making tools for planning and management that are robust to future uncertainties; with examination and understanding of uncertainties within the modelling system.

"Climate Change Impacts on Marine Ecosystems","In marine ecosystems, rising atmospheric CO2 and climate change are associated with concurrent shifts in temperature, circulation, stratification, nutrient input, oxygen content, and ocean acidification, with potentially wide-ranging biological effects. Population-level shifts are occurring because of physiological intolerance to new environments, altered dispersal patterns, and changes in species interactions. Together with local climate-driven invasion and extinction, these processes result in altered community structure and diversity, including possible emergence of novel ecosystems. Impacts are particularly striking for the poles and the tropics, because of the sensitivity of polar ecosystems to sea-ice retreat and poleward species migrations as well as the sensitivity of coral-algal symbiosis to minor increases in temperature. Midlatitude upwelling systems, like the California Current, exhibit strong linkages between climate and species distributions, phenology, and demography. Aggregated effects may modify energy and material flows as well as biogeochemical cycles, eventually impacting the overall ecosystem functioning and services upon which people and societies depend.","Doney, SC; Ruckelshaus, M; Duffy, JE; Barry, JP; Chan, F; English, CA; Galindo, HM; Grebmeier, JM; Hollowed, AB; Knowlton, N; Polovina, J; Rabalais, NN; Sydeman, WJ; Talley, LD",2012,"ANNUAL REVIEW OF MARINE SCIENCE, VOL 4"
"Impact of climate change on marine pelagic phenology and trophic mismatch","Phenology, the study of annually recurring life cycle events such as the timing of migrations and flowering, can provide particularly sensitive indicators of climate change(1). Changes in phenology may be important to ecosystem function because the level of response to climate change may vary across functional groups and multiple trophic levels. The decoupling of phenological relationships will have important ramifications for trophic interactions, altering food-web structures and leading to eventual ecosystem-level changes. Temperate marine environments may be particularly vulnerable to these changes because the recruitment success of higher trophic levels is highly dependent on synchronization with pulsed planktonic production(2,3). Using long-term data of 66 plankton taxa during the period from 1958 to 2002, we investigated whether climate warming signals(4) are emergent across all trophic levels and functional groups within an ecological community. Here we show that not only is the marine pelagic community responding to climate changes, but also that the level of response differs throughout the community and the seasonal cycle, leading to a mismatch between trophic levels and functional groups.","Edwards, M; Richardson, AJ",2004,"NATURE"
"Conserving biodiversity under climate change: the rear edge matters","Modern climate change is producing poleward range shifts of numerous taxa, communities and ecosystems worldwide. The response of species to changing environments is likely to be determined largely by population responses at range margins. In contrast to the expanding edge, the low-latitude limit (rear edge) of species ranges remains understudied, and the critical importance of rear edge populations as long-term stores of species' genetic diversity and foci of speciation has been little acknowledged. We review recent findings from the fossil record, phylogeography and ecology to illustrate that rear edge populations are often disproportionately important for the survival and evolution of biota. Their ecological features, dynamics and conservation requirements differ from those of populations in other parts of the range, and some commonly recommended conservation practices might therefore be of little use or even counterproductive for rear edge populations.","Hampe, A; Petit, RJ",2005,"ECOLOGY LETTERS"
"Climate change and human health: present and future risks","There is near unanimous scientific consensus that greenhouse gas emissions generated by human activity will change Earth's climate. The recent (globally averaged) warming by 0.5 degrees C is partly attributable to such anthropogenic emissions. Climate change will affect human health in many ways-mostly adversely. Here, we summarise the epidemiological evidence of how climate variations and trends affect various health outcomes. We assess the little evidence there is that recent global warming has already affected some health outcomes. We review the published estimates of future health effects of climate change over coming decades. Research so far has mostly focused on thermal stress, extreme weather events, and infectious diseases, with some attention to estimates of future regional food yields and hunger prevalence. An emerging broader approach addresses a wider spectrum of health risks due to the social, demographic, and economic disruptions of climate change. Evidence and anticipation of adverse health effects will strengthen the case for pre-emptive policies, and will also guide priorities for planned adaptive strategies.","McMichael, AJ; Woodruff, RE; Hales, S",2006,"LANCET"

"Causes of climate change over the past 1000 years","Recent reconstructions of Northern Hemisphere temperatures and climate forcing over the past 1000 years allow the warming of the 20th century to be placed within a historical context and various mechanisms of climate change to be tested. Comparisons of observations with simulations from an energy balance climate model indicate that as much as 41 to 64% of preanthropogenic (pre-1850) decadal-scale temperature variations was due to changes in solar irradiance and volcanism. Removal of the forced response from reconstructed temperature time series yields residuals that show similar variability to those of control runs of coupled models, thereby lending support to the models' value as estimates of low-frequency variability in the climate system. Removal of all forcing except greenhouse gases from the similar to 1000-year time series results in a residual with a very large late-20th-century warming that closely agrees with the response predicted from greenhouse gas forcing. The combination of a unique level of temperature increase in the late 20th century and improved constraints on the role of natural variability provides further evidence that the greenhouse effect has already established itself above the level of natural variability in the climate system. A 21st-century global warming projection far exceeds the natural variability of the past 1000 years and is greater than the best estimate of global temperature change for the last interglacial.","Crowley, TJ",2000,"SCIENCE"
"The velocity of climate change","The ranges of plants and animals are moving in response to recent changes in climate(1). As temperatures rise, ecosystems with 'nowhere to go', such as mountains, are considered to be more threatened(2,3). However, species survival may depend as much on keeping pace with moving climates as the climate's ultimate persistence(4,5). Here we present a new index of the velocity of temperature change (km yr(-1)), derived from spatial gradients (degrees C km(-1)) and multimodel ensemble forecasts of rates of temperature increase (degrees C yr(-1)) in the twenty-first century. This index represents the instantaneous local velocity along Earth's surface needed to maintain constant temperatures, and has a global mean of 0.42 km yr(-1) (A1B emission scenario). Owing to topographic effects, the velocity of temperature change is lowest in mountainous biomes such as tropical and subtropical coniferous forests (0.08 km yr(-1)), temperate coniferous forest, and montane grasslands. Velocities are highest in flooded grasslands (1.26 km yr(-1)), mangroves and deserts. High velocities suggest that the climates of only 8% of global protected areas have residence times exceeding 100 years. Small protected areas exacerbate the problem in Mediterranean-type and temperate coniferous forest biomes. Large protected areas may mitigate the problem in desert biomes. These results indicate management strategies for minimizing biodiversity loss from climate change. Montane landscapes may effectively shelter many species into the next century.

These crops comprise two of the four largest sources of caloric energy produced and are thus critical for world food supply. We pair a panel of county-level yields for these two crops, plus cotton (a warmer-weather crop), with a new fine-scale weather dataset that incorporates the whole distribution of temperatures within each day and across all days in the growing season. We find that yields increase with temperature up to 29 degrees C for corn, 30 degrees C for soybeans, and 32 degrees C for cotton but that temperatures above these thresholds are very harmful. The slope of the decline above the optimum is significantly steeper than the incline below it. The same nonlinear and asymmetric relationship is found when we isolate either time-series or cross-sectional variations in temperatures and yields. This suggests limited historical adaptation of seed varieties or management practices to warmer temperatures because the cross-section includes farmers' adaptations to warmer climates and the time-series does not. Holding current growing regions fixed, area-weighted average yields are predicted to decrease by 30-46% before the end of the century under the slowest (B1) warming scenario and decrease by 63-82% under the most rapid warming scenario (A1FI) under the Hadley III model.","Schlenker, W; Roberts, MJ",2009,"PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA"
"Interpretation of recent Southern Hemisphere climate change","Climate variability in the high-latitude Southern Hemisphere (SH) is dominated by the SH annular mode, a large-scale pattern of variability characterized by fluctuations in the strength of the circumpolar vortex. We present evidence that recent trends in the SH tropospheric circulation can be interpreted as a bias toward the high-index polarity of this pattern, with stronger westerly flow encircling the polar cap. It is argued that the largest and most significant tropospheric trends can be traced to recent trends in the lower stratospheric polar vortex, which are due largely to photochemical ozone losses. During the summer-fall season, the trend toward stronger circumpolar flow has contributed substantially to the observed warming over the Antarctic Peninsula and Patagonia and to the cooling over eastern Antarctica and the Antarctic plateau.","Thompson, DWJ; Solomon, S",2002,"SCIENCE"
"Climate change and the permafrost carbon feedback","Large quantities of organic carbon are stored in frozen soils (permafrost) within Arctic and sub-Arctic regions. Awarming climate can induce environmental changes that accelerate the microbial breakdown of organic carbon and the release of the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide and methane. This feedback can accelerate climate change, but the magnitude and timing of greenhouse gas emission from these regions and their impact on climate change remain uncertain. Here we find that current evidence suggests a gradual and prolonged release of greenhouse gas emissions in a warming climate and present a research strategy with which to target poorly understood aspects of permafrost carbon dynamics.","Schuur, EAG; McGuire, AD; Schadel, C; Grosse, G; Harden, JW; Hayes, DJ; Hugelius, G; Koven, CD; Kuhry, P; Lawrence, DM; Natali, SM; Olefeldt, D; Romanovsky, VE; Schaefer, K; Turetsky, MR; Treat, CC; Vonk, JE",2015,"NATURE"
"Climate change impacts, adaptive capacity, and vulnerability of European forest ecosystems","This study compiles and summarizes the existing knowledge about observed and projected impacts of climate change on forests in Europe. Forests will have to adapt not only to changes in mean climate variables but also to increased variability with greater risk of extreme weather events, such as prolonged drought, storms and floods. Sensitivity, potential impacts, adaptive capacity, and vulnerability to climate change are reviewed for European forests. The most important potential impacts of climate change on forest goods and services are summarized for the Boreal, Temperate Oceanic, Temperate Continental, Mediterranean, and mountainous regions. Especially in northern and western Europe the increasing atmospheric CO2 content and warmer temperatures are expected to result in positive effects on forest growth and wood production, at least in the short-medium term. On the other hand, increasing drought and disturbance risks will cause adverse effects. These negative impacts are very likely to outweigh positive trends in southern and eastern Europe. From west to east, the drought risk increases. In the Mediterranean regions productivity is expected to decline due to strongly increased droughts and fire risks. Adaptive capacity consists of the inherent adaptive capacity of trees and forest ecosystems and of socio-economic factors determining the capability to implement planned adaptation. The adaptive capacity in the forest sector is relatively large in the Boreal and the Temperate Oceanic regions, more constrained by socio-economic factors in the Temperate Continental, and most limited in the Mediterranean region where large forest areas are only extensively managed or unmanaged. Potential impacts and risks are best studied and understood with respect to wood production. It is clear that all other goods and services provided by European forests will also be impacted by climate change, but much less knowledge is available to quantify these impacts. Understanding of adaptive capacity and regional vulnerability to climate change in European forests is not well developed and requires more focussed research efforts. An interdisciplinary research agenda integrated with monitoring networks and projection models is needed to provide information at all levels of decision making, from policy development to the management unit.

"Are there social limits to adaptation to climate change?","While there is a recognised need to adapt to changing climatic conditions, there is an emerging discourse of limits to such adaptation. Limits are traditionally analysed as a set of immutable thresholds in biological, economic or technological parameters. This paper contends that limits to adaptation are endogenous to society and hence contingent on ethics, knowledge, attitudes to risk and culture. We review insights from history, sociology and psychology of risk, economics and political science to develop four propositions concerning limits to adaptation. First, any limits to adaptation depend on the ultimate goals of adaptation underpinned by diverse values. Second, adaptation need not be limited by uncertainty around future foresight of risk. Third, social and individual factors limit adaptation action. Fourth, systematic undervaluation of loss of places and culture disguises real, experienced but subjective limits to adaptation. We conclude that these issues of values and ethics, risk, knowledge and culture construct societal limits to adaptation, but that these limits are mutable.","Adger, WN; Dessai, S; Goulden, M; Hulme, M; Lorenzoni, I; Nelson, DR; Naess, LO; Wolf, J; Wreford, A",2009,"CLIMATIC CHANGE"
"Amazonia Through Time: Andean Uplift, Climate Change, Landscape Evolution, and Biodiversity","The Amazonian rainforest is arguably the most species-rich terrestrial ecosystem in the world, yet the timing of the origin and evolutionary causes of this diversity are a matter of debate. We review the geologic and phylogenetic evidence from Amazonia and compare it with uplift records from the Andes. This uplift and its effect on regional climate fundamentally changed the Amazonian landscape by reconfiguring drainage patterns and creating a vast influx of sediments into the basin. On this ""Andean"" substrate, a region-wide edaphic mosaic developed that became extremely rich in species, particularly in Western Amazonia. We show that Andean uplift was crucial for the evolution of Amazonian landscapes and ecosystems, and that current biodiversity patterns are rooted deep in the pre-Quaternary.","Hoorn, C; Wesselingh, FP; ter Steege, H; Bermudez, MA; Mora, A; Sevink, J; Sanmartin, I; Sanchez-Meseguer, A; Anderson, CL; Figueiredo, JP; Jaramillo, C; Riff, D; Negri, FR; Hooghiemstra, H; Lundberg, J; Stadler, T; Sarkinen, T; Antonelli, A",2010,"SCIENCE"
"Climate change affects marine fishes through the oxygen limitation of thermal tolerance","A cause-and-effect understanding of climate influences on ecosystems requires evaluation of thermal limits of member species and of their ability to cope with changing temperatures. Laboratory data available for marine fish and invertebrates from various climatic regions led to the hypothesis that, as a unifying principle, a mismatch between the demand for oxygen and the capacity of oxygen supply to tissues is the first mechanism to restrict whole-animal tolerance to thermal extremes. We show in the eelpout, Zoarces viviparus, a bioindicator fish species for environmental monitoring from North and Baltic Seas (Helcom), that thermally limited oxygen delivery closely matches environmental temperatures beyond which growth performance and abundance decrease. Decrements in aerobic performance in warming seas will thus be the first process to cause extinction or relocation to cooler waters.","Portner, HO; Knust, R",2007,"SCIENCE"
"Climate change hot-spots","A Regional Climate Change Index (RCCI), is developed based on regional mean precipitation change, mean surface air temperature change, and change in precipitation and temperature interannual variability. The RCCI is a comparative index designed to identify the most responsive regions to climate change, or Hot-Spots. The RCCI is calculated for 26 land regions from the latest set of climate change projections by 20 global climate models for the A1B, A2 and B1 IPCC emission scenarios. The Mediterranean and North Eastern European regions emerge as the primary Hot-Spots, followed by high latitude northern hemisphere regions and by Central America, the most prominent tropical Hot-Spot. The main African Hot-Spots are Southern Equatorial Africa and the Sahara. Eastern North America is the prominent Hot-Spot over the continental U. S. Different factors over different regions contribute to the magnitude of the RCCI, which is in fact greater than 0 for all regions.","Giorgi, F",2006,"GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS"
"The rising tide: assessing the risks of climate change and human settlements in low elevation coastal zones","Settlements in coastal lowlands are especially vulnerable to risks resulting from climate change, yet these lowlands are densely settled and growing rapidly. In this paper, we undertake the first global review of the population and urban settlement patterns in the Low Elevation Coastal Zone (LECZ), defined here as the contiguous area along the coast that is less than 10 metres above sea level. Overall, this zone covers 2 per cent of the world's land area but contains 10 per cent of the world's population and 13 per cent of the world's urban population. A disproportionate number of the countries with a large share of their population in this zone are small island countries, but most of the countries with large populations in the zone are large countries with heavily populated delta regions. On average, the Least Developed Countries have a higher share of their population living in the zone (14 per cent) than do OECD countries (10 per cent), with even greater disparities in the urban shares (21 per cent compared to I I per cent). Almost two-thirds of urban settlements with populations greater than 5 million fall, at least partly, in the zone. In some countries (most notably China), urbanization is driving a movement in population towards the coast. Reducing the risk of disasters related to climate change in coastal settlements will require a combination of mitigation, migration and settlement modification.","McGranahan, G; Balk, D; Anderson, B",2007,"ENVIRONMENT AND URBANIZATION"
"Mountain pine beetle and forest carbon feedback to climate change","The mountain pine beetle ( Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins, Coleoptera: Curculionidae, Scolytinae) is a native insect of the pine forests of western North America, and its populations periodically erupt into large- scale outbreaks(1-3). During outbreaks, the resulting widespread tree mortality reduces forest carbon uptake and increases future emissions from the decay of killed trees. The impacts of insects on forest carbon dynamics, however, are generally ignored in large- scale modelling analyses. The current outbreak in British Columbia, Canada, is an order of magnitude larger in area and severity than all previous recorded outbreaks(4). Here we estimate that the cumulative impact of the beetle outbreak in the affected region during 2000 - 2020 will be 270 megatonnes ( Mt) carbon ( or 36 g carbon m(-2) yr(-1) on average over 374,000 km 2 of forest). This impact converted the forest from a small net carbon sink to a large net carbon source both during and immediately after the outbreak. In the worst year, the impacts resulting from the beetle outbreak in British Columbia were equivalent to similar to 75% of the average annual direct forest fire emissions from all of Canada during 1959 - 1999. The resulting reduction in net primary production was of similar magnitude to increases observed during the 1980s and 1990s as a result of global change(5). Climate change has contributed to the unprecedented extent and severity of this outbreak(6). Insect outbreaks such as this represent an important mechanism by which climate change may undermine the ability of northern forests to take up and store atmospheric carbon, and such impacts should be accounted for in large- scale modelling analyses.","Kurz, WA; Dymond, CC; Stinson, G; Rampley, GJ; Neilson, ET; Carroll, AL; Ebata, T; Safranyik, L",2008,"NATURE"

"Social capital, collective action, and adaptation to climate change","Future changes in climate pose significant challenges for society, not the least of which is how best to adapt to observed and potential future impacts of these changes to which the world is already committed. Adaptation is a dynamic social process: the ability of societies to adapt is determined, in part, by the ability to act collectively. This article reviews emerging perspectives on collective action and social capital and argues that insights from these areas inform the nature of adaptive capacity and normative prescriptions of policies of adaptation. Specifically, social capital is increasingly understood within economics to have public and private elements, both of which are based on trust, reputation, and reciprocal action. The public-good aspects of particular forms of social capital are pertinent elements of adaptive capacity in interacting with natural capital and in relation to the performance of institutions that cope with the risks of changes in climate. Case studies are presented of present-day collective action for coping with extremes in weather in coastal areas in Southeast Asia and of community-based coastal management in the Caribbean. These cases demonstrate the importance of social capital framing both the public and private institutions of resource management that build resilience in the face of the risks of changes in climate. These cases illustrate, by analogy, the nature of adaptation processes and collective action in adapting to future changes in climate.","Adger, WN",2003,"ECONOMIC GEOGRAPHY"
"Quantification of modelling uncertainties in a large ensemble of climate change simulations","Comprehensive global climate models(1) are the only tools that account for the complex set of processes which will determine future climate change at both a global and regional level. Planners are typically faced with a wide range of predicted changes from different models of unknown relative quality(2,3), owing to large but unquantified uncertainties in the modelling process(4). Here we report a systematic attempt to determine the range of climate changes consistent with these uncertainties, based on a 53-member ensemble of model versions constructed by varying model parameters. We estimate a probability density function for the sensitivity of climate to a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, and obtain a 5 - 95 per cent probability range of 2.4-5.4degreesC. Our probability density function is constrained by objective estimates of the relative reliability of different model versions, the choice of model parameters that are varied and their uncertainty ranges, specified on the basis of expert advice. Our ensemble produces a range of regional changes much wider than indicated by traditional methods based on scaling the response patterns of an individual simulation(5,6).","Murphy, JM; Sexton, DMH; Barnett, DN; Jones, GS; Webb, MJ; Stainforth, DA",2004,"NATURE"
"Sustainable biochar to mitigate global climate change","Production of biochar (the carbon (C)-rich solid formed by pyrolysis of biomass) and its storage in soils have been suggested as a means of abating climate change by sequestering carbon, while simultaneously providing energy and increasing crop yields. Substantial uncertainties exist, however, regarding the impact, capacity and sustainability of biochar at the global level. In this paper we estimate the maximum sustainable technical potential of biochar to mitigate climate change. Annual net emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane and nitrous oxide could be reduced by a maximum of 1.8Pg CO2-C equivalent (CO2-C-e) per year (12% of current anthropogenic CO2-C-e emissions; 1Pg = 1Gt), and total net emissions over the course of a century by 130 Pg CO2-C-e, without endangering food security, habitat or soil conservation. Biochar has a larger climate-change mitigation potential than combustion of the same sustainably procured biomass for bioenergy, except when fertile soils are amended while coal is the fuel being offset.","Woolf, D; Amonette, JE; Street-Perrott, FA; Lehmann, J; Joseph, S",2010,"NATURE COMMUNICATIONS"
"EURO-CORDEX: new high-resolution climate change projections for European impact research","A new high-resolution regional climate change ensemble has been established for Europe within the World Climate Research Program Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (EURO-CORDEX) initiative. The first set of simulations with a horizontal resolution of 12.5 km was completed for the new emission scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 with more simulations expected to follow. The aim of this paper is to present this data set to the different communities active in regional climate modelling, impact assessment and adaptation. The EURO-CORDEX ensemble results have been compared to the SRES A1B simulation results achieved within the ENSEMBLES project. The large-scale patterns of changes in mean temperature and precipitation are similar in all three scenarios, but they differ in regional details, which can partly be related to the higher resolution in EURO-CORDEX. The results strengthen those obtained in ENSEMBLES, but need further investigations. The analysis of impact indices shows that for RCP8.5, there is a substantially larger change projected for temperature-based indices than for RCP4.5. The difference is less pronounced for precipitation-based indices. Two effects of the increased resolution can be regarded as an added value of regional climate simulations. Regional climate model simulations provide higher daily precipitation intensities, which are completely missing in the global climate model simulations, and they provide a significantly different climate change of daily precipitation intensities resulting in a smoother shift from weak to moderate and high intensities.","Jacob, D; Petersen, J; Eggert, B; Alias, A; Christensen, OB; Bouwer, LM; Braun, A; Colette, A; Deque, M; Georgievski, G; Georgopoulou, E; Gobiet, A; Menut, L; Nikulin, G; Haensler, A; Hempelmann, N; Jones, C; Keuler, K; Kovats, S; Kroner, N; Kotlarski, S; Kriegsmann, A; Martin, E; van Meijgaard, E; Moseley, C; Pfeifer, S; Preuschmann, S; Radermacher, C; Radtke, K; Rechid, D; Rounsevell, M; Samuelsson, P; Somot, S; Soussana, JF; Teichmann, C; Valentini, R; Vautard, R; Weber, B; Yiou, P",2014,"REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE"
"Climate change and forests of the future: Managing in the face of uncertainty","We offer a conceptual framework for managing forested ecosystems under an assumption that future environments will be different from present but that we cannot be certain about the specifics of change. We encourage flexible approaches that promote reversible and incremental steps, and that favor ongoing learning and capacity to modify direction as situations change. We suggest that no single solution fits all future challenges, especially in the context of changing climates, and that the best strategy is to mix different approaches for different situations. Resources managers will be challenged to integrate adaptation strategies ( actions that help ecosystems accommodate changes adaptively) and mitigation strategies ( actions that enable ecosystems to reduce anthropogenic influences on global climate) into overall plans. Adaptive strategies include resistance options ( forestall impacts and protect highly valued resources), resilience options ( improve the capacity of ecosystems to return to desired conditions after disturbance), and response options ( facilitate transition of ecosystems from current to new conditions). Mitigation strategies include options to sequester carbon and reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions. Priority-setting approaches ( e. g., triage), appropriate for rapidly changing conditions and for situations where needs are greater than available capacity to respond, will become increasingly important in the future.","Millar, CI; Stephenson, NL; Stephens, SL",2007,"ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS"

As well as making a strong case for going beyond what I refer to as the dominant paradigm of 'ABC'-attitude, behaviour, and choice-I discuss the attractions of this model, the blind spots it creates, and the forms of governance it sustains. This exercise provides some insight into why so much relevant social theory remains so marginalised, and helps identify opportunities for making better use of existing intellectual resources.","Shove, E",2010,"ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A-ECONOMY AND SPACE"
"The rise of harmful cyanobacteria blooms: The potential roles of eutrophication and climate change","Cyanobacteria are the most ancient phytoplankton on the planet and form harmful algal blooms in freshwater, estuarine, and marine ecosystems. Recent research suggests that eutrophication and climate change are two processes that may promote the proliferation and expansion of cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms. In this review, we specifically examine the relationships between eutrophication, climate change and representative cyanobacterial genera from freshwater (Microcystis, Anabaena, Cylindrospermopsis), estuarine (Nodularia, Aphanizomenon), and marine ecosystems (Lyngbya, Synechococcus, Trichodesmium). Commonalities among cyanobacterial genera include being highly competitive for low concentrations of inorganic P (DIP) and the ability to acquire organic P compounds. Both diazotrophic (= nitrogen (N-2) fixers) and non-diazotrophic cyanobacteria display great flexibility in the N sources they exploit to form blooms. Hence, while some cyanobacterial blooms are associated with eutrophication, several form blooms when concentrations of inorganic N and P are low. Cyanobacteria dominate phytoplankton assemblages under higher temperatures due to both physiological (e.g. more rapid growth) and physical factors (e.g. enhanced stratification), with individual species showing different temperature optima. Significantly less is known regarding how increasing carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations will affect cyanobacteria, although some evidence suggests several genera of cyanobacteria are well-suited to bloom under low concentrations of CO2. While the interactive effects of future eutrophication and climate change on harmful cyanobacterial blooms are complex, much of the current knowledge suggests these processes are likely to enhance the magnitude and frequency of these events.

"Adaptation, migration or extirpation: climate change outcomes for tree populations","Species distribution models predict a wholesale redistribution of trees in the next century, yet migratory responses necessary to spatially track climates far exceed maximum post-glacial rates. The extent to which populations will adapt will depend upon phenotypic variation, strength of selection, fecundity, interspecific competition, and biotic interactions. Populations of temperate and boreal trees show moderate to strong clines in phenology and growth along temperature gradients, indicating substantial local adaptation. Traits involved in local adaptation appear to be the product of small effects of many genes, and the resulting genotypic redundancy combined with high fecundity may facilitate rapid local adaptation despite high gene flow. Gene flow with preadapted alleles from warmer climates may promote adaptation and migration at the leading edge, while populations at the rear will likely face extirpation. Widespread species with large populations and high fecundity are likely to persist and adapt, but will likely suffer adaptational lag for a few generations. As all tree species will be suffering lags, interspecific competition may weaken, facilitating persistence under suboptimal conditions. Species with small populations, fragmented ranges, low fecundity, or suffering declines due to introduced insects or diseases should be candidates for facilitated migration.","Aitken, SN; Yeaman, S; Holliday, JA; Wang, TL; Curtis-McLane, S",2008,"EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS"
"THE COMMUNITY EARTH SYSTEM MODEL (CESM) LARGE ENSEMBLE PROJECT A Community Resource for Studying Climate Change in the Presence of Internal Climate Variability","While internal climate variability is known to affect climate projections, its influence is often underappreciated and confused with model error. Why? In general, modeling centers contribute a small number of realizations to international climate model assessments [e.g., phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5)]. As a result, model error and internal climate variability are difficult, and at times impossible, to disentangle. In response, the Community Earth System Model (CESM) community designed the CESM Large Ensemble (CESM-LE) with the explicit goal of enabling assessment of climate change in the presence of internal climate variability. All CESM-LE simulations use a single CMIP5 model (CESM with the Community Atmosphere Model, version 5). The core simulations replay the twenty to twenty-first century (1920-2100) 30 times under historical and representative concentration pathway 8.5 external forcing with small initial condition differences. Two companion 1000+-yr-long preindustrial control simulations (fully coupled, prognostic atmosphere and land only) allow assessment of internal climate variability in the absence of climate change. Comprehensive outputs, including many daily fields, are available as single-variable time series on the Earth System Grid for anyone to use. Early results demonstrate the substantial influence of internal climate variability on twentieth- to twenty-first-century climate trajectories. Global warming hiatus decades occur, similar to those recently observed. Internal climate variability alone can produce projection spread comparable to that in CMIP5. Scientists and stakeholders can use CESM-LE outputs to help interpret the observational record, to understand projection spread and to plan for a range of possible futures influenced by both internal climate variability and forced climate change.","Kay, JE; Deser, C; Phillips, A; Mai, A; Hannay, C; Strand, G; Arblaster, JM; Bates, SC; Danabasoglu, G; Edwards, J; Holland, M; Kushner, P; Lamarque, JF; Lawrence, D; Lindsay, K; Middleton, A; Munoz, E; Neale, R; Oleson, K; Polvani, L; Vertenstein, M",2015,"BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY"
"Climate Change Impacts on Global Food Security","Climate change could potentially interrupt progress toward a world without hunger. A robust and coherent global pattern is discernible of the impacts of climate change on crop productivity that could have consequences for food availability. The stability of whole food systems may be at risk under climate change because of short-term variability in supply. However, the potential impact is less clear at regional scales, but it is likely that climate variability and change will exacerbate food insecurity in areas currently vulnerable to hunger and undernutrition. Likewise, it can be anticipated that food access and utilization will be affected indirectly via collateral effects on household and individual incomes, and food utilization could be impaired by loss of access to drinking water and damage to health. The evidence supports the need for considerable investment in adaptation and mitigation actions toward a ""climate-smart food system"" that is more resilient to climate change influences on food security.","Wheeler, T; von Braun, J",2013,"SCIENCE"
"Mid- to Late Holocene climate change: an overview","The last 6000 years are of particular interest to the understanding of the Earth System because the boundary conditions of the climate system did not change dramatically (in comparison to larger glacial-interglacial changes), and because abundant, detailed regional palaeoclimatic proxy records cover this period. We use selected proxy-based reconstructions of different climate variables, together with state-of-the-art time series of natural forcings (orbital variations, solar activity variations, large tropical volcanic eruptions, land cover and greenhouse gases), underpinned by results from General Circulation Models (GCMs) and Earth System Models of Intermediate Complexity (EMICs), to establish a comprehensive explanatory framework for climate changes from the Mid-Holocene (MH) to pre-industrial time. The redistribution of solar energy, due to orbital forcing on a millennia] timescale, was the cause of a progressive southward shift of the Northern Hemisphere (NH) summer position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). This was accompanied by a pronounced weakening of the monsoon systems in Africa and Asia and increasing dryness and desertification on both continents. The associated summertime cooling of the NH, combined with changing temperature gradients in the world oceans, likely led to an increasing amplitude of the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and, possibly, increasingly negative North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) indices up to the beginning of the last millennium. On decadal to multi-century timescales, a worldwide coincidence between solar irradiance minima, tropical volcanic eruptions and decadal to multi-century scale cooling events was not found. However, reconstructions show that widespread decadal to multi-century scale cooling events, accompanied by advances of mountain glaciers, occurred in the NH (e.g., in Scandinavia and the European Alps). This occurred namely during the Little Ice Age (LIA) between AD similar to 1350 and 1850, when the lower summer insolation in the NH, due to orbital forcing, coincided with solar activity minima and several strong tropical volcanic eruptions. The role of orbital forcing in the NH cooling, the southward ITCZ shift and the desertification of the Sahara are supported by numerous model simulations. Other simulations have suggested that the fingerprint of solar activity variations should be strongest in the tropics, but there is also evidence that changes in the ocean heat transport took place during the LIA at high northern latitudes, with possible additional implications for climates of the Southern Hemisphere (SH).

"Modern global climate change","Modern climate change is dominated by human influences, which are now large enough to exceed the bounds of natural variability. The main source of global climate change is human-induced changes in atmospheric composition. These perturbations primarily result from emissions associated with energy use, but on local and regional scales, urbanization and land use changes are also important. Although there has been progress in monitoring and understanding climate change, there remain many scientific, technical, and institutional impediments to precisely planning for, adapting to, and mitigating the effects of climate change. There is still considerable uncertainty about the rates of change that can be expected, but it is clear that these changes will be increasingly manifested in important and tangible ways, such as changes in extremes of temperature and precipitation, decreases in seasonal and perennial snow and ice extent, and sea level rise. Anthropogenic climate change is now likely to continue for many centuries. We are venturing into the unknown with climate, and its associated impacts could be quite disruptive.","Karl, TR; Trenberth, KE",2003,"SCIENCE"

"Climate change projections using the IPSL-CM5 Earth System Model: from CMIP3 to CMIP5","We present the global general circulation model IPSL-CM5 developed to study the long-term response of the climate system to natural and anthropogenic forcings as part of the 5th Phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). This model includes an interactive carbon cycle, a representation of tropospheric and stratospheric chemistry, and a comprehensive representation of aerosols. As it represents the principal dynamical, physical, and bio-geochemical processes relevant to the climate system, it may be referred to as an Earth System Model. However, the IPSL-CM5 model may be used in a multitude of configurations associated with different boundary conditions and with a range of complexities in terms of processes and interactions. This paper presents an overview of the different model components and explains how they were coupled and used to simulate historical climate changes over the past 150 years and different scenarios of future climate change. A single version of the IPSL-CM5 model (IPSL-CM5A-LR) was used to provide climate projections associated with different socio-economic scenarios, including the different Representative Concentration Pathways considered by CMIP5 and several scenarios from the Special Report on Emission Scenarios considered by CMIP3. Results suggest that the magnitude of global warming projections primarily depends on the socio-economic scenario considered, that there is potential for an aggressive mitigation policy to limit global warming to about two degrees, and that the behavior of some components of the climate system such as the Arctic sea ice and the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation may change drastically by the end of the twenty-first century in the case of a no climate policy scenario. Although the magnitude of regional temperature and precipitation changes depends fairly linearly on the magnitude of the projected global warming (and thus on the scenario considered), the geographical pattern of these changes is strikingly similar for the different scenarios. The representation of atmospheric physical processes in the model is shown to strongly influence the simulated climate variability and both the magnitude and pattern of the projected climate changes.","Dufresne, JL; Foujols, MA; Denvil, S; Caubel, A; Marti, O; Aumont, O; Balkanski, Y; Bekki, S; Bellenger, H; Benshila, R; Bony, S; Bopp, L; Braconnot, P; Brockmann, P; Cadule, P; Cheruy, F; Codron, F; Cozic, A; Cugnet, D; de Noblet, N; Duvel, JP; Ethe, C; Fairhead, L; Fichefet, T; Flavoni, S; Friedlingstein, P; Grandpeix, JY; Guez, L; Guilyardi, E; Hauglustaine, D; Hourdin, F; Idelkadi, A; Ghattas, J; Joussaume, S; Kageyama, M; Krinner, G; Labetoulle, S; Lahellec, A; Lefebvre, MP; Lefevre, F; Levy, C; Li, ZX; Lloyd, J; Lott, F; Madec, G; Mancip, M; Marchand, M; Masson, S; Meurdesoif, Y; Mignot, J; Musat, I; Parouty, S; Polcher, J; Rio, C; Schulz, M; Swingedouw, D; Szopa, S; Talandier, C; Terray, P; Viovy, N; Vuichard, N",2013,"CLIMATE DYNAMICS"
"Erosion of Lizard Diversity by Climate Change and Altered Thermal Niches","It is predicted that climate change will cause species extinctions and distributional shifts in coming decades, but data to validate these predictions are relatively scarce. Here, we compare recent and historical surveys for 48 Mexican lizard species at 200 sites. Since 1975, 12% of local populations have gone extinct. We verified physiological models of extinction risk with observed local extinctions and extended projections worldwide. Since 1975, we estimate that 4% of local populations have gone extinct worldwide, but by 2080 local extinctions are projected to reach 39% worldwide, and species extinctions may reach 20%. Global extinction projections were validated with local extinctions observed from 1975 to 2009 for regional biotas on four other continents, suggesting that lizards have already crossed a threshold for extinctions caused by climate change.","Sinervo, B; Mendez-de-la-Cruz, F; Miles, DB; Heulin, B; Bastiaans, E; Cruz, MVS; Lara-Resendiz, R; Martinez-Mendez, N; Calderon-Espinosa, ML; Meza-Lazaro, RN; Gadsden, H; Avila, LJ; Morando, M; De la Riva, IJ; Sepulveda, PV; Rocha, CFD; Ibarguengoytia, N; Puntriano, CA; Massot, M; Lepetz, V; Oksanen, TA; Chapple, DG; Bauer, AM; Branch, WR; Clobert, J; Sites, JW",2010,"SCIENCE"
"Climate change risk perception and policy preferences: The role of affect, imagery, and values","A national, representative survey of the U.S. public found that Americans have moderate climate change risk perceptions, strongly support a variety of national and international policies to mitigate climate change, and strongly oppose several carbon tax proposals. Drawing on the theoretical distinction between analytic and experiential decision-making, this study found that American risk perceptions and policy support are strongly influenced by experiential factors, including affect, imagery, and values, and demonstrates that public responses to climate change are influenced by both psychological and socio-cultural factors.","Leiserowitz, A",2006,"CLIMATIC CHANGE"
"Adapting agriculture to climate change","The strong trends in climate change already evident, the likelihood of further changes occurring, and the increasing scale of potential climate impacts give urgency to addressing agricultural adaptation more coherently. There are many potential adaptation options available for marginal change of existing agricultural systems, often variations of existing climate risk management. We show that implementation of these options is likely to have substantial benefits under moderate climate change for some cropping systems. However, there are limits to their effectiveness under more severe climate changes. Hence, more systemic changes in resource allocation need to be considered, such as targeted diversification of production systems and livelihoods. We argue that achieving increased adaptation action will necessitate integration of climate change-related issues with other risk factors, such as climate variability and market risk, and with other policy domains, such as sustainable development. Dealing with the many barriers to effective adaptation will require a comprehensive and dynamic policy approach covering a range of scales and issues, for example, from the understanding by farmers of change in risk profiles to the establishment of efficient markets that facilitate response strategies. Science, too, has to adapt. Multidisciplinary problems require multidisciplinary solutions, i.e., a focus on integrated rather than disciplinary science and a strengthening of the interface with decision makers. A crucial component of this approach is the implementation of adaptation assessment frameworks that are relevant, robust, and easily operated by all stakeholders, practitioners, policymakers, and scientists.","Howden, SM; Soussana, JF; Tubiello, FN; Chhetri, N; Dunlop, M; Meinke, H",2007,"PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA"

Further, the effects of educational attainment and self-reported understanding on global warming beliefs and concern are positive for liberals and Democrats, but are weaker or negative for conservatives and Republicans.

"PRECIPITATION DOWNSCALING UNDER CLIMATE CHANGE: RECENT DEVELOPMENTS TO BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN DYNAMICAL MODELS AND THE END USER","Precipitation downscaling improves the coarse resolution and poor representation of precipitation in global climate models and helps end users to assess the likely hydrological impacts of climate change. This paper integrates perspectives from meteorologists, climatologists, statisticians, and hydrologists to identify generic end user (in particular, impact modeler) needs and to discuss downscaling capabilities and gaps. End users need a reliable representation of precipitation intensities and temporal and spatial variability, as well as physical consistency, independent of region and season. In addition to presenting dynamical downscaling, we review perfect prognosis statistical downscaling, model output statistics, and weather generators, focusing on recent developments to improve the representation of space-time variability. Furthermore, evaluation techniques to assess downscaling skill are presented. Downscaling adds considerable value to projections from global climate models. Remaining gaps are uncertainties arising from sparse data; representation of extreme summer precipitation, subdaily precipitation, and full precipitation fields on fine scales; capturing changes in small-scale processes and their feedback on large scales; and errors inherited from the driving global climate model.","Maraun, D; Wetterhall, F; Ireson, AM; Chandler, RE; Kendon, EJ; Widmann, M; Brienen, S; Rust, HW; Sauter, T; Themessl, M; Venema, VKC; Chun, KP; Goodess, CM; Jones, RG; Onof, C; Vrac, M; Thiele-Eich, I",2010,"REVIEWS OF GEOPHYSICS"
"Biodiversity management in the face of climate change: A review of 22 years of recommendations","Climate change creates new challenges for biodiversity conservation. Species ranges and ecological dynamics are already responding to recent climate shifts, and current reserves will not continue to support all species they were designed to protect. These problems are exacerbated by other global changes. Scholarly articles recommending measures to adapt conservation to climate change have proliferated over the last 22 years. We systematically reviewed this literature to explore what potential solutions it has identified and what consensus and direction it provides to cope with climate change. Several consistent recommendations emerge for action at diverse spatial scales, requiring leadership by diverse actors. Broadly, adaptation requires improved regional institutional coordination, expanded spatial and temporal perspective, incorporation of climate change scenarios into all planning and action, and greater effort to address multiple threats and global change drivers simultaneously in ways that are responsive to and inclusive of human communities. However, in the case of many recommendations the how, by whom, and under what conditions they can be implemented is not specified. We synthesize recommendations with respect to three likely conservation pathways: regional planning; site-scale management; and modification of existing conservation plans. We identify major gaps, including the need for (1) more specific, operational examples of adaptation principles that are consistent with unavoidable uncertainty about the future; (2) a practical adaptation planning process to guide selection and integration of recommendations into existing policies and programs; and (3) greater integration of social science into an endeavor that, although dominated by ecology, increasingly recommends extension beyond reserves and into human-occupied landscapes.

"Effects of climate change on global food production under SRES emissions and socio-economic scenarios","This paper analyses the global consequences to crop yields, production, and risk of hunger of linked socio-economic and climate scenarios. Potential impacts of climate change are estimated for climate change scenarios developed from the HadCM3 global climate model under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A1FI, A2, B I, and B2. Projected changes in yield are calculated using transfer functions derived from crop model simulations with observed climate data and projected climate change scenarios. The basic linked system (BLS) is used to evaluate consequent changes in global cereal production, cereal prices and the number of people at risk from hunger. The crop yield results elucidate the complex regional patterns of projected climate variables, CO2 effects, and agricultural systems that contribute to aggregations of global crop production. The A1FI scenario, as expected with its large increase in global temperatures, exhibits the greatest decreases both regionally and globally in yields, especially by the 2080s. The contrast between the yield change in developed and developing countries is largest under the A2a-c scenarios. Under the 131 and B2 scenarios, developed and developing countries exhibit less contrast in crop yield changes, with the B2 future crop yield changes being slightly more favourable than those of the B1 scenario. When crop yield results are introduced to the BLS world food trade system model, the combined model and scenario experiments demonstrate that the world, for the most part, appears to be able to continue to feed itself under the SRES scenarios during the rest of this century. However, this outcome is achieved through production in the developed countries (which mostly benefit from climate change) compensating for declines projected, for the most part, for developing nations. While global production appears stable, regional differences in crop production are likely to grow stronger through time, leading to a significant polarisation of effects, with substantial increases in prices and risk of hunger amongst the poorer nations, especially under scenarios of greater inequality (A1FI and A2). The use of the SRES scenarios highlights several non-linearities in the world food supply system, both in the biophysical sense, where the levels of atmospheric CO2 tested reach new levels, and the socio-economic sense, where changes in population dynamics and economic and political structures complicate the translation of biophysical climate change impacts into social indices, such as the number of people at risk of hunger.

"Evidence and implications of recent climate change in northern Alaska and other arctic regions","The Arctic climate is changing. Permafrost is warming, hydrological processes are changing and biological and social systems are also evolving in response to these changing conditions. Knowing how the structure and function of arctic terrestrial ecosystems are responding to recent and persistent climate change is paramount to understanding the future state of the Earth system and how humans will need to adapt. Our holistic review presents a broad array of evidence that illustrates convincingly; the Arctic is undergoing a system-wide response to an altered climatic state. New extreme and seasonal surface climatic conditions are being experienced, a range of biophysical states and processes influenced by the threshold and phase change of freezing point are being altered, hydrological and biogeochemical cycles are shifting, and more regularly human sub-systems are being affected. Importantly, the patterns, magnitude and mechanisms of change have sometimes been unpredictable or difficult to isolate due to compounding factors. In almost every discipline represented, we show how the biocomplexity of the Arctic system has highlighted and challenged a paucity of integrated scientific knowledge, the lack of sustained observational and experimental time series, and the technical and logistic constraints of researching the Arctic environment. This study supports ongoing efforts to strengthen the interdisciplinarity of arctic system science and improve the coupling of large scale experimental manipulation with sustained time series observations by incorporating and integrating novel technologies, remote sensing and modeling.","Hinzman, LD; Bettez, ND; Bolton, WR; Chapin, FS; Dyurgerov, MB; Fastie, CL; Griffith, B; Hollister, RD; Hope, A; Huntington, HP; Jensen, AM; Jia, GJ; Jorgenson, T; Kane, DL; Klein, DR; Kofinas, G; Lynch, AH; Lloyd, AH; McGuire, AD; Nelson, FE; Oechel, WC; Osterkamp, TE; Racine, CH; Romanovsky, VE; Stone, RS; Stow, DA; Sturm, M; Tweedie, CE; Vourlitis, GL; Walker, MD; Walker, DA; Webber, PJ; Welker, JM; Winker, K; Yoshikawa, K",2005,"CLIMATIC CHANGE"

"Land-atmosphere coupling and climate change in Europe","Increasing greenhouse gas concentrations are expected to enhance the interannual variability of summer climate in Europe(1-3) and other mid-latitude regions(4,5), potentially causing more frequent heatwaves(1,3,5,6). Climate models consistently predict an increase in the variability of summer temperatures in these areas, but the underlying mechanisms responsible for this increase remain uncertain. Here we explore these mechanisms using regional simulations of recent and future climatic conditions with and without land - atmosphere interactions. Our results indicate that the increase in summer temperature variability predicted in central and eastern Europe is mainly due to feedbacks between the land surface and the atmosphere. Furthermore, they suggest that land - atmosphere interactions increase climate variability in this region because climatic regimes in Europe shift northwards in response to increasing greenhouse gas concentrations, creating a new transitional climate zone with strong land - atmosphere coupling in central and eastern Europe. These findings emphasize the importance of soil- moisture - temperature feedbacks ( in addition to soil- moisture - precipitation feedbacks(7-10)) in influencing summer climate variability and the potential migration of climate zones with strong land - atmosphere coupling(7,11) as a consequence of global warming. This highlights the crucial role of land atmosphere interactions in future climate change.","Seneviratne, SI; Luthi, D; Litschi, M; Schar, C",2006,"NATURE"
"Global flood risk under climate change","A warmer climate would increase the risk of floods(1). So far, only a few studies(2,3) have projected changes in floods on a global scale. None of these studies relied on multiple climate models. A few global studies(4,5) have started to estimate the exposure to flooding (population in potential inundation areas) as a proxy of risk, but none of them has estimated it in a warmer future climate. Here we present global flood risk for the end of this century based on the outputs of 11 climate models. A state-of-the-art global river routing model with an inundation scheme(6) was employed to compute river discharge and inundation area. An ensemble of projections under a new high-concentration scenario(7) demonstrates a large increase in flood frequency in Southeast Asia, Peninsular India, eastern Africa and the northern half of the Andes, with small uncertainty in the direction of change. In certain areas of the world, however, flood frequency is projected to decrease. Another larger ensemble of projections under four new concentration scenarios(7) reveals that the global exposure to floods would increase depending on the degree of warming, but interannual variability of the exposure may imply the necessity of adaptation before significant warming.","Hirabayashi, Y; Mahendran, R; Koirala, S; Konoshima, L; Yamazaki, D; Watanabe, S; Kim, H; Kanae, S",2013,"NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE"
"The physiology of climate change: how potentials for acclimatization and genetic adaptation will determine 'winners' and 'losers'","Physiological studies can help predict effects of climate change through determining which species currently live closest to their upper thermal tolerance limits, which physiological systems set these limits, and how species differ in acclimatization capacities for modifying their thermal tolerances. Reductionist studies at the molecular level can contribute to this analysis by revealing how much change in sequence is needed to adapt proteins to warmer temperatures - thus providing insights into potential rates of adaptive evolution - and determining how the contents of genomes - protein-coding genes and gene regulatory mechanisms influence capacities for adapting to acute and long-term increases in temperature. Studies of congeneric invertebrates from thermally stressful rocky intertidal habitats have shown that warm-adapted congeners are most susceptible to local extinctions because their acute upper thermal limits (LT50 values) lie near current thermal maxima and their abilities to increase thermal tolerance through acclimation are limited. Collapse of cardiac function may underlie acute and longer-term thermal limits. Local extinctions from heat death may be offset by in-migration of genetically warm-adapted conspecifics from mid-latitude 'hot spots', where midday low tides in summer select for heat tolerance. A single amino acid replacement is sufficient to adapt a protein to a new thermal range. More challenging to adaptive evolution are lesions in genomes of stenotherms like Antarctic marine ectotherms, which have lost protein-coding genes and gene regulatory mechanisms needed for coping with rising temperature. These extreme stenotherms, along with warm-adapted eurytherms living near their thermal limits, may be the major 'losers' from climate change.","Somero, GN",2010,"JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY"
"Global imprint of climate change on marine life","Past meta-analyses of the response of marine organisms to climate change have examined a limited range of locations(1,2), taxonomic groups(2-4) and/or biological responses(5,6). This has precluded a robust overview of the effect of climate change in the global ocean. Here, we synthesized all available studies of the consistency of marine ecological observations with expectations under climate change. This yielded a meta-database of 1,735 marine biological responses for which either regional or global climate change was considered as a driver. Included were instances of marine taxa responding as expected, in a manner inconsistent with expectations, and taxa demonstrating no response. From this database, 81-83% of all observations for distribution, phenology, community composition, abundance, demography and calcification across taxa and ocean basins were consistent with the expected impacts of climate change. Of the species responding to climate change, rates of distribution shifts were, on average, consistent with those required to track ocean surface temperature changes. Conversely, we did not find a relationship between regional shifts in spring phenology and the seasonality of temperature. Rates of observed shifts in species' distributions and phenology are comparable to, or greater, than those for terrestrial systems.","Poloczanska, ES; Brown, CJ; Sydeman, WJ; Kiessling, W; Schoeman, DS; Moore, PJ; Brander, K; Bruno, JF; Buckley, LB; Burrows, MT; Duarte, CM; Halpern, BS; Holding, J; Kappel, CV; O'Connor, MI; Pandolfi, JM; Parmesan, C; Schwing, F; Thompson, SA; Richardson, AJ",NA,"NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE"

Results indicate strong negative effects of climate change, especially at higher levels of warming and at low latitudes; models that include explicit nitrogen stress project more severe impacts. Across seven GGCMs, five global climate models, and four representative concentration pathways, model agreement on direction of yield changes is found in many major agricultural regions at both low and high latitudes; however, reducing uncertainty in sign of response in mid-latitude regions remains a challenge. Uncertainties related to the representation of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and high temperature effects demonstrated here show that further research is urgently needed to better understand effects of climate change on agricultural production and to devise targeted adaptation strategies.","Rosenzweig, C; Elliott, J; Deryng, D; Ruane, AC; Muller, C; Arneth, A; Boote, KJ; Folberth, C; Glotter, M; Khabarov, N; Neumann, K; Piontek, F; Pugh, TAM; Schmid, E; Stehfest, E; Yang, H; Jones, JW",2014,"PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA"

"Climate change vulnerability assessments: An evolution of conceptual thinking","Vulnerability is an emerging concept for climate science and policy. Over the past decade, efforts to assess vulnerability to climate change triggered a process of theory development and assessment practice, which is reflected in the reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). This paper reviews the historical development of the conceptual ideas underpinning assessments of vulnerability to climate change. We distinguish climate impact assessment, first- and second-generation vulnerability assessment, and adaptation policy assessment. The different generations of assessments are described by means of a conceptual framework that defines key concepts of the assessment and their analytical relationships. The purpose of this conceptual framework is two-fold: first, to present a consistent visual glossary of the main concepts underlying the IPCC approach to vulnerability and its assessment; second, to show the evolution of vulnerability assessments. This evolution is characterized by the progressive inclusion of non-climatic determinants of vulnerability to climate change, including adaptive capacity, and the shift from estimating expected damages to attempting to reduce them. We hope that this paper improves the understanding of the main approaches to climate change vulnerability assessment and their evolution, not only within the climate change community but also among researchers from other scientific communities, who are sometimes puzzled by the unfamiliar use of technical terms in the context of climate change.","Fussel, HM; Klein, RJT",2006,"CLIMATIC CHANGE"

"Phase shifts, herbivory, and the resilience of coral reefs to climate change","Many coral reefs worldwide have undergone phase shifts to alternate, degraded assemblages because of the combined effects of overfishing, declining water quality, and the direct and indirect impacts of climate change [1-9]. Here, we experimentally manipulated the density of large herbivorous fishes to test their influence on the resilience of coral assemblages in the aftermath of regional-scale bleaching in 1998, the largest coral mortality event recorded to date. The experiment was undertaken on the Great Barrier Reef, within a no-fishing reserve where coral abundances and diversity had been sharply reduced by bleaching [10]. In control areas, where fishes were abundant, algal abundance remained low, whereas coral cover almost doubled (to 20%) over a 3 year period, primarily because of recruitment of species that had been locally extirpated by bleaching. In contrast, exclusion of large herbivorous fishes caused a dramatic explosion of macroalgae, which suppressed the fecundity, recruitment, and survival of corals. Consequently, management of fish stocks is a key component in preventing phase shifts and managing reef resilience. Importantly, local stewardship of fishing effort is a tractable goal for conservation of reefs, and this local action can also provide some insurance against larger-scale disturbances such as mass bleaching, which are impractical to manage directly.","Hughes, TP; Rodrigues, MJ; Bellwood, DR; Ceccarelli, D; Hoegh-Guldberg, O; McCook, L; Moltschaniwskyj, N; Pratchett, MS; Steneck, RS; Willis, B",2007,"CURRENT BIOLOGY"
