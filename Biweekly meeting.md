	* Comments:
		* Cristian: How to select the sample size? Is to 100 a really a right size? We may need to calculate it methodologically. 
			* > From previous literature it seems that 300 can be a good number, and 1000 would be a good safe number.
			* Kajikawa: It depends on the confident intervals. We may need to check of target journals and learn what are the confident levels required by the journals and compute samples base don that.

	* Comments:
		* > Is it ok to start contact members of the supply value chain for the purpose of interview?
			* Kajikawa: No problem.
			* Okumura: How about doing a consumer survey first, or contact the stakeholders first?
				* *> Better to establish relationship with related companies to have inputs that enrich potential consumer surveys. 
				* Kajikawa: Advice to check previous literature for deign the interview and questionnaires, to be more informed when contact these stakeholders. Also decide who is the person who will answered these questions. (i.e. design of the interview, and interview process)
			* Ranjit: Suggest to research about "corruption" because this topic appear well-defined when studying multinationals, and the "brokers" play a role on buffering this.

				* > Not sure. But will check.

				* Kajikawa: Then, we can focuse on the functions, and the usage of the patents.
* Presenter: Cristian.
	* Contents: 
		* Progress on name disambiguation for the shareolder-ghg analysis. Okumura-san worked on finding the matches.

			* Holdings are the one listed as public companies but subsidiaries are the ones reporting ghg
			* Listed company and reported company have different names
	* Comments:
		* Okumura: Some industries have more coverage than others. So, we may need to classified the companies by industry first, and work on those with more data.
		* Kajikawa: Focus on the larger CO2 emitters first, then report how much coverage we have in terms of CO2, not in company numbers.
