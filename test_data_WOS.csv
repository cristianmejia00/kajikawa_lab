"1","Creativity and psychopathology: Two sides of the same coin?","however, it is also commonly believed to be associated with psychopathology. This has been examined, starting with Lombroso's investigation of genius and madness in 1800s followed by a dearth of literature debating the association between the two. This evidence for this polarizing issue ranges from psychometric to neuroscientific disciplines and creates ambiguity neither refuting nor accepting this association completely. Through this article, we briefly review the literature on this subject and try to decipher what is written in between the lines, how creativity and psychopathology may fuel each other, and what may be its clinical implications.","Reddy, IR; Ukrani, J; Indla, V; Ukrani, V",2018,0,"INDIAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY","INDIAN J PSYCHIAT","V60","2","Review","Creativity; mad genius; psychopathology","LATENT INHIBITION; BRITISH WRITERS; MENTAL-ILLNESS; ACHIEVEMENT; PERSONALITY; ARTISTS; INTELLIGENCE; ASSOCIATION; SCHIZOTYPY; PSYCHOSIS","0019-5545","10.4103/psychiatry.IndianJPsychiatry_129_18","WOS:000442523600003"
"2","Creativity as a Matter of Choice: Prior Experience and Task Instruction as Boundary Conditions for the Positive Effect of Choice on Creativity","This study investigates the effects of prior experience, task instruction, and choice on creative performance. Although extant research suggests that giving people choice in how they approach a task could enhance creative performance, we propose that this view needs to be circumscribed. Specifically, we argue that when choice is administered during problem solving by varying the number of available resources, the high combinatorial flexibility conferred by a large choice set of resources can be overwhelming. Through two experiments, we found that only individuals with high prior experience in the task domain and given explicit instruction to be creative produced more creative outcomes when given more choice. When either of these two conditions is not met (i.e., low prior experience or given non-creativity instruction), more choice did not lead to more creative performance. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.","Chua, RYJ; Iyengar, SS",2008,33,"JOURNAL OF CREATIVE BEHAVIOR","J CREATIVE BEHAV","V42","3","Article","Choice; Experience; Task Instruction; Creativity","INTRINSIC MOTIVATION; SELECTIVE RETENTION; SOCIAL-PSYCHOLOGY; BLIND VARIATION; TEST-SCORES; PERFORMANCE; WORK; ORGANIZATIONS; DIVERGENT; AUTONOMY","0022-0175","10.1002/j.2162-6057.2008.tb01293.x","WOS:000261518500002"

"4","Organizational Support and Creativity: The Role of Developmental Experiences as a Moderator","The study focuses on employees' creativity as a source for organizational competitiveness in a highly globalized business environment. The study also proposes that creativity can only be achieved with support from the organization. Support comes in the form of developmental experiences provided by the organization for the employees. Perceived organizational support for creativity is the independent variable to creativity's dependent variable with developmental experiences as the moderator. Respondents for the study are 100 employees from the electrical/electronic manufacturing sector in Penang, Malaysia. The study found that the IV predicts the DV and developmental experiences' role as a moderator is significant. The result indicates that support provided by the organization is a significant factor in generating creativity among their employees. (C) 2016 The Authors.

"5","Evaluation of a classroom program of creative expression workshops for refugee and immigrant children","Objective: This evaluative study assessed the effect of a creative expression program designed to prevent emotional and behavioral problems and to enhance self-esteem in immigrant and refugee children attending multiethnic schools. Method: The 12-week program involved 138 children, aged 7 to 13, registered in both integration classes designed for immigrant children and regular classes at two elementary schools. Pretest and posttest data were collected from the children themselves and from their teacher. Teachers used Achenbach's Teacher's Report Form to assess the emotional and behavioral symptoms of their pupils whereas children self-reported their symptoms with the Dominic, a computerized questionnaire. Self-esteem was measured with the Piers-Harris Self-Concept Scale administered by inter-viewers to the children. Results: At the end of the program, the children in the experimental groups reported lower mean levels of internalizing and externalizing symptoms and higher mean levels of feelings of popularity and satisfaction than the children in the control groups, when controlling for baseline data. In integration classes, the effect on self-esteem was especially notable in boys. The intervention's effect on internalizing and externalizing symptoms was not modified by gender, age or fluency in the mainstream language. Conclusion: The study provides some evidence that creative workshops in the classroom can have a beneficial effect on the self-esteem and symptomatology of immigrant and refugee children from various cultures and backgrounds. These quantitative results support previous qualitative analysis showing that the workshops participate in the reconstruction of a meaningful personal world while simultaneously strengthening the link of the child to the group. They also transform the teachers' perceptions of newcomers by placing an emphasis on their strength and their resilience, while not negating their vulnerabilities.","Rousseau, C; Drapeau, A; Lacroix, L; Bagilishya, D; Heusch, N",2005,55,"JOURNAL OF CHILD PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRY","J CHILD PSYCHOL PSYC","V46","2","Article","prevention; art therapy; immigrant and refugee children; mental health","","0021-9630","10.1111/j.1469-7610.2004.00344.x","WOS:000226887600006"

Design: Narrative storytelling approach. Method: A first-person story was developed from the participant's own words taken verbatim from an in-depth semi-structured interview. A series of focus groups were conducted with members of the general public (n = 20) to reflect upon the story. Results: The story provides a rich and holistic account of the participant's experiences and unique insight to the complex interaction between the social and psychological factors associated with illness and recovery. The story also highlights the value attributed to the AS & AAT in an individual's recovery journey. Conclusions: This paper offers important insights into the personal meaning and value of participation in a bespoke 5-day AS & AAT programme. Feedback from the participant and focus groups with members of the general public who engaged with the story suggest judgement criteria appropriate for a creative non-fiction representation were achieved.","Peacock, S; Carless, D; McKenna, J",2018,0,"PSYCHOLOGY OF SPORT AND EXERCISE","PSYCHOL SPORT EXERC","V35","","Article","Storytelling; Creative non-fiction; Military; Recovery; Sport; Adventure","MENTAL-HEALTH; POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; COMBAT VETERANS; REHABILITATION; STORIES; PARTICIPATION; EXPERIENCE; IMPACT; STIGMA","1469-0292","10.1016/j.psychsport.2017.12.003","WOS:000426331600018"

"11","Are Creative Ideas Novel and Useful?","It is a central assumption in creativity theory that the creativity of an idea is defined by its novelty and usefulness. The present study examined this notion by investigating how the perceived novelty and usefulness actually contribute to the overall evaluation of creativity. We collected responses to a verbal and a figural divergent thinking task in a sample of 1,500 participants. All ideas were evaluated for novelty, usefulness, or creativity by a total of 18 independent judges. Results generally indicate a greater importance of novelty than usefulness in the prediction of creativity scores. Novelty and usefulness interacted significantly in the prediction of creativity both as a linear and as a nonlinear term. An examination of the interaction between novelty and usefulness suggests that usefulness is predictive of creativity only within highly novel ideas. In conclusion, novelty can be regarded as a first-order criterion and usefulness as a second-order criterion of creativity: If an idea is not novel its usefulness does not matter much, but if an idea is novel its usefulness will additionally determine its actual creativity.","Diedrich, J; Benedek, M; Jauk, E; Neubauer, AC",2015,38,"PSYCHOLOGY OF AESTHETICS CREATIVITY AND THE ARTS","PSYCHOL AESTHET CREA","V9","1","Article","creativity; novelty; usefulness; divergent thinking","DIVERGENT THINKING; ORIGINALITY; APPROPRIATENESS; JUDGMENTS","1931-3896","10.1037/a0038688","WOS:000350351300006"

While the creative sector now makes up close to 30 percent of China's urban private employment, industry-based earnings disparity has also increased substantively. Provinces with larger creative economy also tend to have higher level of wage inequality among workers of the creative sector, the working sector, and the service sector. Several other factors, especially internal migration flow, size of manufacturing, and ownership structure in local economy, are found to be significantly linked to inequality as well.","Liu, CY; Xie, W",2013,5,"GROWTH AND CHANGE","GROWTH CHANGE","V44","4","Article","","WAGE INEQUALITY; DIFFERENTIALS; TRANSITION; EMPLOYMENT; EARNINGS; GROWTH; SYSTEM","0017-4815","10.1111/grow.12023","WOS:000328578900004"

The portrayal of the offbeat theoretical physicist, Dr. Sheldon Cooper, on the TV show The Big Bang Theory is one such recent characterization that resonates with the mad-genius stereotype. In this article, I evaluate the validity of Sheldon's psychological profile against existing literature and isolate the cognitive processes that differentiate his ""autistic-creativity"" from ""schizotypic-creativity."" Further, I hypothesize that such characterizations of creative individuals can either reinforce the stereotype of the eccentric-genius or challenge normative definitions of normality. I reinterpret the creativity-pathology link from a humanistic perspective to mean that psychological health is not the absence of despair but the pursuit of creative generativity despite personal distress. Accordingly, I speculate that people will always be fascinated by eccentric-geniuses, even fictive ones such as Dr. Sheldon Cooper, because they compel us toward authentic creativity and away from arbitrary conformity.","Winston, CN",2016,0,"PSYCHOLOGY OF POPULAR MEDIA CULTURE","PSYCHOL POP MEDIA CU","V5","3","Article","Sheldon Cooper; The Big Bang Theory; eccentricity; genius; creativity","","2160-4134","10.1037/ppm0000060","WOS:000439060100006"
"15","Visionary leadership and employee creativity in China","Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore how visionary leadership influences employees' creativity in R&D teams in China, and the role of employee knowledge sharing and goal orientation. Design/methodology/approach A survey was conducted on 331 professional technical engineers in R&D departments of 62 high-tech corporations in China. Hierarchical regression was used to model the relationships between visionary leadership style, employee goal orientations, knowledge sharing and employee creativity. Findings The results show that visionary leadership is positively associated with employee creativity in Chinese organizations and the relationship is positively mediated by employee knowledge sharing. Furthermore, employee learning goal orientation strengthens the relationship between visionary leadership and employee knowledge sharing, whereas employee performance-avoid goal orientation weakens the relationship between visionary leadership and employee knowledge sharing. Originality/value This study contributes to the literature on the effects of leadership on employee creativity by showing that, contrary to western organizations, where a less directive leadership style is generally recommended to enhance employee creativity, in Chinese organizations, visionary leadership is positively associated with employee creativity, but the effect is contingent on employees' goal orientations and knowledge sharing.","Zhou, LL; Zhao, SM; Tian, F; Zhang, XF; Chen, S",2018,2,"INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANPOWER","INT J MANPOWER","V39","1","Article","China; Goal orientation; Leadership; Creativity; Collectivist culture; Knowledge sharing; Visionary leadership","TRANSFORMATIONAL LEADERSHIP; GOAL ORIENTATION; ORGANIZATIONAL CREATIVITY; KNOWLEDGE; PERSPECTIVE; COUNTRIES; CULTURES; SUPPORT; CONTEXT","0143-7720","10.1108/IJM-04-2016-0092","WOS:000430137800006"

Results from a laboratory study (N=73) showed that evaluation expectation exerted different effects on variation and selective retention. During variation, individuals who expected external evaluation generated fewer numbers of ideas. On the other hand, during selective retention, individuals who expected external evaluation performed better in improving idea appropriateness. Finally, individuals who expected evaluation only during selective retention produced the most creative ideas. These results provide a possible explanation for the inconsistent findings documented in the literature. Implications of these results for future research were discussed.","Yuan, FR; Zhou, J",2008,39,"CREATIVITY RESEARCH JOURNAL","CREATIVITY RES J","V20","4","Article","","SELECTIVE RETENTION; EMPLOYEE CREATIVITY; REWARD INCREASE; BLIND VARIATION; PERFORMANCE; THINKING","1040-0419","10.1080/10400410802391827","WOS:000260639900006"

Moment","While there are well-known anecdotes and documented insight cases by renowned scientists and inventors, little is known about the experiences of insight in the general population. The present study aimed to determine peoples' self-reported experience of insight in their daily lives. Using an online questionnaire, responses were obtained from 1,114 respondents. Eighty-percent reported having insights. These respondents reported demographic information and answered three open-ended questions on where their insights occur, what insights are and other thoughts on insight. A greater percentage of those who have insights are, female, younger, highly educated, and involved in occupations including, management, sciences, arts and service professions. The qualitative results uncovered eight major themes, reflecting on the places people have insights: At night, work, shower, home, when it is quiet, transport, while exercising, and in nature. Two major themes emerged on what insights are: Something from the subconscious, and a result of (not) thinking. Finally, three major themes emerged from the third question on thoughts they would like to share on insight: The improvement of insight with age, the importance of analyzing the details of the problem, and the unexpectedness of the solution.

The results suggest the enhancement of creativity in response to open-ended problems is significantly affected by the process employed by the decision maker rather than the vehicle by which the process is delivered. Further, the results indicate that the capability of a decision support system (DSS) to provide directed guidance in the application of a process combined with user knowledge of the underlying process model improves creativity enhancement over use of either the DSS or the process alone.","Marakas, GM; Elam, JJ",1997,34,"MANAGEMENT SCIENCE","MANAGE SCI","V43","8","Article","creativity enhancement; problem-solving; decision support; DSS design","ADJECTIVE CHECK LIST; COMPUTER; SYSTEMS; SUPPORT; DSS","0025-1909","10.1287/mnsc.43.8.1136","WOS:A1997XR72700007"

It is admitted that these competences present necessary professional content for innovative economy specialists. Creative competences are understood by the authors as the ability of a specialist to find responsible unique solution in extraordinary situation. The course of ""Creativity of engineer"" is used as the method of creative competences formation. This course is based on the combination of approaches to personal activity development in solving unusual tasks along with the formation of environment favorable for the search of spontaneous and unobvious answers to different questions. The article sums up the experience of the course teaching gained during the period of 2015-2016. It is observed that even with evident positive results of this course provision, the authors of the course face problems (students' social inactivity, high turnover of students, law level of educational training), which ironically proves the relevance of this educational subject in the system of engineering education.","Igor, A; Nikolay, V; Irina, G; Marina, S",2016,0,"VISION 2020: INNOVATION MANAGEMENT, DEVELOPMENT SUSTAINABILITY, AND COMPETITIVE ECONOMIC GROWTH, 2016, VOLS I - VII","","","","Proceedings Paper","creative competences; engineering education; innovations","PERSPECTIVE; ISSUES","","","WOS:000392785700372"
"29","Convergent, but not divergent, thinking predicts susceptibility to associative memory illusions","The relationship between creativity and susceptibility to associative memory illusions in the Deese/Roediger-McDermott procedure was investigated using a multiple regression analysis. Susceptibility to false recognition was significantly predicted by performance on a measure of convergent thinking (the Remote Associates Task) but not by performance on a measure of divergent thinking (the Alternative Uses Task).

"30","A Schumpeterian Model of Entrepreneurship, Innovation, and Regional Economic Growth","The authors provide the first theoretical analysis of a one-sector, discrete-time, Schumpeterian model of growth in a regional economy in which consumers are risk neutral, there is no population growth, monopolistic entrepreneurs produce intermediate goods, and a single consumption good is produced competitively. The authors' analysis generates several new results. In the deterministic model, R&D in time t surely leads to an innovation in time t + 1. In this setting, the authors show that relative to the balanced growth path (BGP) equilibrium, the social planner always allocates more labor to R&D and hence achieves a larger size of innovation and a higher growth rate. Next, in the stochastic model, R&D in time t probabilistically leads to an innovation in time t + 1. In this setting, the authors first define the equilibrium and the steady state BGP allocations. Second, the authors generalize the notion of the steady state and determine the number of unemployed workers. Third, the authors show that the regional economy experiences bursts of unemployment followed by periods of full employment. Finally, the authors show that a decline in the time discount rate increases the average growth rate and the average unemployment.","Batabyal, AA; Nijkamp, P",2012,7,"INTERNATIONAL REGIONAL SCIENCE REVIEW","INT REGIONAL SCI REV","V35","4","Article","creative destruction; dynamic; entrepreneur; innovation; regional economy; stochastic","CREATIVE DESTRUCTION; KNOWLEDGE; PERSPECTIVE; SPACE; TIME","0160-0176","10.1177/0160017612456676","WOS:000308085700005"
"31","Arts-based research practices in music therapy research: Existing and potential developments","Poetry, drama, music, dance, and visual art are increasingly used in healthcare research to learn about the experiences of healthcare workers and recipients, to gain access to marginalized voices, and to communicate research findings to a wide range of people. Despite this emerging inclination towards the recognition of the value of the arts for healthcare research, creative arts processes have had limited use in music therapy research to date. In this article, we reflect on the small body of existing music therapy literature about arts-based research and explore possible reasons for the current neglect of these methods. We provide examples from Alison's doctoral research that demonstrate the value of using arts-based research for developing a deeper understanding of the profession of music therapy. Our reflection on the current literature leads us to propose further uses for arts-based research practices, for developing rich and evocative findings, accessing the voices of people who receive music therapy services, and communicating music therapy research findings to a broader audience eager for this information.

"33","Understanding and enhancing personal transfer of creative learning","The 'actor-orientated transfer' approach was adopted to examine the personal transfer of creative learning in a thematic course on toys in a higher education of Hong Kong. The personal transfers of creative learning were found to be spontaneous, far, diverse, multidirectional, highly individual and, sometimes, quite unexpected. Creativity-related attitudes, conceptions, habits and thinking strategies were commonly transferred from the initial study over to daily life, new learning and teaching, all because the learning was impressive, useful, full of surprises and easy to remember. A number of curricular, contextual and student's personal factors were identified to be either facilitating or hindering these transfers. It is concluded that significant parts of creative learning can be transferred in personal ways, if the curriculum is suitably designed and implemented to meet the needs of students in local context. A model for personal transfer of creative learning, which consisted of four core themes (i.e. context, content, impact and factor of personal transfer) and their sub-themes, was depicted. The 'transfer in pieces' theory was applied to explain the nature of personal transfer. Ultimately, this study helps to establish a new conception of creativity education as a type of education that values and facilitates personal transfer. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

"34","Functional brain networks underlying idiosyncratic switching patterns in multi-stable auditory perception","In perceptual multi-stability, perception stochastically switches between alternative interpretations of the stimulus allowing examination of perceptual experience independent of stimulus parameters. Previous studies found that listeners show temporally stable idiosyncratic switching patterns when listening to a multi-stable auditory stimulus, such as in the auditory streaming paradigm. This inter-individual variability can be described along two dimensions, Exploration and Segregation. In the current study, we explored the functional brain networks associated with these dimensions and their constituents using electroencephalography. Results showed that Segregation and its constituents are related to brain networks operating in the theta EEG band, whereas Exploration and its constituents are related to networks in the lower and upper alpha and beta bands. Thus, the dimensions on which individuals' perception differ from each other in the auditory streaming paradigm probably reflect separate perceptual processes in the human brain. Further, the results suggest that networks mainly located in left auditory areas underlie the perception of integration, whereas perceiving the alternative patterns is accompanied by stronger interhemispheric connections.","Farkas, D; Denham, SL; Winkler, I",2018,1,"NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA","NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA","V108","","Article","Perceptual multi-stability; Auditory streaming; Individual differences; Functional networks; Minimum spanning tree; EEG","EEG SOURCE LOCALIZATION; CREATIVITY; INTERFERENCE; FREQUENCY; ATTENTION; MODELS","0028-3932","10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2017.11.032","WOS:000423644500010"
"35","The project ecology of advertising: Tasks, talents and teams","In economic geographic analysis, the 'firm' usually is assumed, at least implicitly, as a coherent and unitary economic actor. More recently, however, the integrity of the firm as the basic analytical unit has been undercut by organizational practices which are built instead around 'projects'. By taking up this theoretical challenge, this paper ventures an empirical investigation in which the project features as the central unit of economic action. However, rather than assuming a substitution of the firm by temporary projects, the paper seeks to explore interdependencies between projects and firms as well as other more traditional 'permanent forms' of organization. Against the empirical background of the London advertising industry, the paper delves into the interrelation between projects on the one hand and, on the other, the agencies, personal ties, localities and corporate networks which provide essential sources for project-based organizing. By consecutively embedding projects into these different organizational and social layers, the paper unfolds a space of collaborative practices for which the term project ecology will be proposed.","Grabher, G",2002,321,"REGIONAL STUDIES","REG STUD","V36","3","Review","project organization; project networks; organization ecology; advertising industry; London","ECONOMIC-GEOGRAPHY; COMPLEX PRODUCTS; LEARNING REGION; INNOVATION; ORGANIZATION; SYSTEMS; IMPROVISATION; CREATIVITY; IDENTITY; INDUSTRY","0034-3404","10.1080/00343400220122052","WOS:000175225200004"
"36","Frontal lobe neurology and the creative mind","Concepts from cognitive neuroscience strongly suggest that the prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a crucial role in the cognitive functions necessary for creative thinking. Functional imaging studies have repeatedly demonstrated the involvement of PFC in creativity tasks. Patient studies have demonstrated that frontal damage due to focal lesions or neurodegenerative diseases are associated with impairments in various creativity tasks. However, against all odds, a series of clinical observations has reported the facilitation of artistic production in patients with neurodegenerative diseases affecting PFC, such as frontotemporal dementia (FTD). An exacerbation of creativity in frontal diseases would challenge neuroimaging findings in controls and patients, as well as the theoretical role of prefrontal functions in creativity processes. To explore this paradox, we reported the history of a FTD patient who exhibited the emergence of visual artistic productions during the course of the disease. The patient produced a large amount of drawings, which have been evaluated by a group of professional artists who were blind to the diagnosis. We also reviewed the published clinical cases reporting a change in the artistic abilities in patients with neurological diseases. We attempted to reconcile these clinical observations to previous experimental findings by addressing several questions raised by our review. For instance, to what extent can the cognitive, conative, and affective changes following frontal damage explain changes in artistic abilities? Does artistic exacerbation truly reflect increased creative capacities? These considerations could help to clarify the place of creativity as it has been defined and explored by cognitive neuroscience in artistic creation and may provide leads for future lesion studies.","de Souza, LC; Guimaraes, HC; Teixeira, AL; Caramelli, P; Levy, R; Dubois, B; Volle, E",2014,19,"FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY","FRONT PSYCHOL","V5","","Article","creativity; prefrontal cortex; frontotemporal dementia; artistic; divergent thinking","ROSTRAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; STIMULUS-INDEPENDENT THOUGHT; PASSIVE CONCEPTUAL EXPANSION; FRONTOTEMPORAL DEMENTIA; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; ARTISTIC CREATIVITY; COGNITIVE CONTROL; DEFAULT NETWORK; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; UNCONSCIOUS THOUGHT","1664-1078","10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00761","WOS:000339396800001"

Nonetheless, mechanisms underlying employee green creativity in the tourism industry have been less explored. Our study aims to examine if environmentally-specific servant leadership can foster green creativity among tourism employees via dual mediation paths of green crafting and green role identity. A two-wave survey process was implemented to garner data from employees and their managers from tour operators based in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Results revealed the effect of environmentally-specific servant leadership on employee green creativity through green role identity, green-related resource and challenge seeking behaviors, but not through green task demand reducing behavior. The direct effect of green role identity and its interaction effect with environmentally-specific servant leadership were found significant for green-related resource and challenge seeking behaviors, but not for green task demand reducing behavior.

Maybe It's Not Only Due to Concept Expansion","Multicultural experience refers to those experiences gained through individuals' contact with other cultures. This study focused on exploring whether knowledge of different cultures can improve creative performance-and also how multicultural experiences influenced this performance through changes in individual's physiological mechanisms. Study 1 explored the influence of different cultural priming on creative story-writing tasks. Eighty-nine Chinese college students were randomly assigned to 4 conditions: sole American culture, dual cultures, sole Chinese culture or control condition, and made to watch 45 min slides with cultural elements-including pictures, music and videos,-and then they were asked to complete the creative story-writing task. The results showed that American culture priming group's score was significantly higher than the control condition with regards to the uniqueness and novelty of the creative story-writing task. Study 2 was aimed at exploring the relationship between physiological arousal levels induced by different cultural and creative performance. We divided the whole experiment into five stages,-including the baseline, picture, listening to music, watching video, and completing creative tasks. Through Biofeedback measurement, we recorded the physiological indexes of participants in different groups in every stage, including skin conductance, thermal, electroencephalographic, and heart rate. The results showed that contacting with foreign cultures would increase individuals' physiological arousal level and brain activity, which contributed to the following creative task.","Tan, L; Wang, XQ; Guo, CY; Zeng, RC; Zhou, T; Cao, GK",2019,0,"FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY","FRONT PSYCHOL","V10","","Article","multicultural experience; creativity; physiological awaken; culture shock; cultural priming paradigm","MULTICULTURAL EXPERIENCE; ACHIEVEMENT; PERFORMANCE; ATTENTION; IDENTITY","1664-1078","10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00537","WOS:000464351000001"
"43","Interpersonal and Inter-organizational Networks in the Performing Arts: The Case of Project-Based Organizations in the Live Music Industry","The main aim of the paper is to contribute to the literature on project-based organizations (PBOs), concerning how temporary organizations are nested in an organizational setting that involves interpersonal and inter-organizational networks. Special attention is paid to the performing arts. A PBO is defined here as an organization that uses a one-shot method of organizing transactions, created by the ability of a permanent organization to design an organizational setting using the existing social and productive net. This may be considered a latent, informal network, based on reputation-driven interpersonal relationships. The paper also attempts to explore the relationship between the organizational capabilities to deploy latent networks and their economic performance. The empirical context is live music performances in the Veneto region. The analysis relates to the population of singers who have worked with an organization at least once in 2003, performing at an artistic event within this region. Using statistical techniques and network analysis tools, the analysis reveals the existence of a network of creativity, where the ability of the organizations to deploy latent networks supports their economic performance.","Sedita, SR",2008,29,"INDUSTRY AND INNOVATION","IND INNOV","V15","5","Article","Social network analysis; project-based organizations; live music industry","COMPLEX PRODUCTS; SOCIAL NETWORK; CREATIVITY; TELEVISION; SYSTEMS; EMBEDDEDNESS; ENTERPRISE; MANAGEMENT; INNOVATION; ECOLOGIES","1366-2716","10.1080/13662710802373833","WOS:000263297700004"

In this study, a creative thinking strategy is proposed to cope with this problem. Moreover, an experiment was conducted on 80 freshmen from two classes of a university to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The experimental results show that the proposed approach improved the students' web-based problem solving performance in comparison with the conventional approach in terms of ""problem finding"" and ""idea finding."" Moreover, it was found that the proposed approach could improve the ""fact finding"" performance of the students with intuitive-type cognitive style. Accordingly, some implications and suggestions are given for educators who attempt to conduct web-based problem-solving activity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

"47","Beyond eureka moments: supporting the invisible work of creativity and innovation","Introduction. This paper is about the challenges of working creatively and reflectively in the information-intensive environments characteristic of our digital age. Method. The paper builds upon earlier work about uncertainty in library and information science by incorporating work exploring risk cultures and uncertainty as everyday phenomena. It presents arguments emerging from an ongoing investigation of the background work involved in scholarly research practice. These threads are used to invite discussion about the particular strategic contribution that the ISIC community might make in answer to calls for more creativity and greater support for the human spirit in all that we do. Analysis. Ethnographic material about scholarly research practice is combined with varied research exploring creativity and uncertainty. Results. Analysis of conditions that can stimulate creativity suggests that working through and being in uncertainty provides a site of creativity stimulation that addresses Howkins's query about how and where we wish to do our thinking. Conclusions. As information researchers and practitioners, we can act as stewards within our communities and help shape the information services and infrastructures that support organisations and communities striving to be more creative and to engage with information in inventive ways. Doing so will require us to not only support the creativity and innovation of others, but to be creative and innovative ourselves.","Anderson, TD",2011,6,"INFORMATION RESEARCH-AN INTERNATIONAL ELECTRONIC JOURNAL","INFORM RES","V16","1","Article; Proceedings Paper","","INFORMATION-SEEKING; SCHOLARLY RESEARCH; UNCERTAINTY; RISK; SYSTEMS; JUDGMENTS; RELEVANCE; LIFE; USER","1368-1613","","WOS:000293286700017"

Initially, the socio-material standpoint is presented, followed by an introduction to our theorizing on emergence in creative processes. We exemplify and discuss how various creative subject-object relations at Roskilde Festival, a Danish music and arts event, become meaningful in a process of emergence involving various levels of creative contribution, ranging from paying and volunteering participants, through the professional organization, to the headlining artists. We thereby illustrate how 'Roskilde Festival' is ritually re-created and saturated with cultural, symbolic meaning - how Roskilde Festival serves as a 'macro-structure' motivating and justifying creative behaviour at the lower levels of the emergent phenomenon. The article ends with a general appraisal of the theoretical perspectives presented, discussing the value of increased analytical attention to emergent phenomena in addition to their individual contributions.","Hvidtfeldt, DL; Tanggaard, L",2019,0,"CULTURE & PSYCHOLOGY","CULT PSYCHOL","V25","4","Article","Creativity; cultural psychology; emergence; Roskilde Festival; socio-materiality","","1354-067X","10.1177/1354067X18820653","WOS:000486287400006"

Unpacking Seoul's Creative City Programmes","This paper critically examines the Seoul city government's attempts at the policy transfer of creative cities programmes, both as a policy borrower and as a policy lender, by using the emergent 'policy mobilities' approach. Seoul's way of actualising the idea of creative cities places more emphasis on local-serving administration, tourism and physical cultural infrastructure. The original creative city programmes have been transformed, ideologically and materially, by Seoul into a process of downsizing government organisations and workforce and limiting the use of public space. Seoul's attempt to be a policy lender is not a product of other foreign cities' policy transfer from Seoul, but the result of the city government's promotional practices. Its final outcome, thus bears relatively little relationship or similarity to the original policies, encountering unexpected administrative and operational problems, such as increasing debt and resistance from civil groups.","Lee, YS; Hwang, EJ",2012,11,"URBAN STUDIES","URBAN STUD","V49","13","Article","","CITIES; MANAGEMENT; KNOWLEDGE; WORLD; STATE","0042-0980","10.1177/0042098012452456","WOS:000308559700003"

Drawing on a mixed method study into the teaching of poetry at post-primary level in Ireland conducted between 2007 and 2010, this paper examines current methodological trends in poetry pedagogy. The research identifies a marked imbalance in the prioritisation of pupil development, with many teachers privileging the cognitive development of pupils' poetic understanding over the affective. The paper also suggests limited attention to the interwoven dimensions of the affective and cognitive domains in the teaching of poetry at senior cycle level in Irish schools. This paper advocates the need to support teachers to develop an integrated pedagogy for teaching poetry in second-level schools, which engages both the critical and the creative in a meaningful manner.","Hennessy, J; Hinchion, C; McNamara, PM",2011,5,"ENGLISH TEACHING-PRACTICE AND CRITIQUE","ENGL TEACH-PRACT CRI","V10","1","Article","Poetry; pedagogy; affective; cognitive; education","CREATIVITY RESEARCH; EMOTION; ARTS","1175-8708","","WOS:000295869300011"

"56","The creation of knowledge: local building, global accessing and economic development-toward an agenda","This article argues that local knowledge building and global (nonlocal) knowledge-accessing practices in economic development are intrinsically interwoven. They generate fundamental feedback loops, which are channeled through and lead to ongoing knowledge circulation. To better understand the nature of the specific mechanisms and conditions underlying these processes, three key areas of research are identified for current and future research. These are related to (i) creative agents and the nature of local creative processes, (ii) community formation and local creativity from ideas to market penetration and (iii) temporary gatherings as translocal knowledge platforms.","Bathelt, H; Cohendet, P",2014,47,"JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC GEOGRAPHY","J ECON GEOGR","V14","5","Article","Creation of knowledge; community formation; economic development; local building; global accessing; knowledge ecosystem","INSTITUTIONAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP; PERSPECTIVE; COMMUNITIES; INNOVATION; GEOGRAPHY; NETWORKS; PROXIMITY","1468-2702","10.1093/jeg/lbu027","WOS:000344619700001"
"57","The Association Between Schizophrenia Risk Variants and Creativity in Healthy Han Chinese Subjects","Although previous evidence has suggested that there is a genetic link between schizophrenia and creativity, the specific genetic variants that underlie the link are still largely unknown. To further explore the potential genetic link between schizophrenia and creativity, in a sample of 580 healthy Han Chinese subjects, this study aimed to (1) validate the role of Neuregulin 1 (NRG1) rs6994992 (one schizophrenia risk variant that has been previously linked to creativity in the European population) in the relationship between schizophrenia and creativity and (2) explore the associations between 10 other schizophrenia risk variants and creativity. For NRG1 rs6994992, the result validated its association with creativity measures. However, since NRG1 rs6994992 is not a schizophrenia risk variant in the Han Chinese population, the validated association suggested that ethnic difference may exist in the relationship between NRG1 rs6994992, schizophrenia and creativity. For other schizophrenia risk variants, the result only demonstrated a nominal association between ZNF536 rs2053079 and creativity measures which would not survive correction for multiple testing. No association between polygenic risk score for these 10 schizophrenia risk variants and creativity measures was observed. In conclusion, this study provides limited evidence for the associations between these schizophrenia risk variants and creativity in healthy Han Chinese subjects. Future studies are warranted to better understand the potential genetic link between schizophrenia and creativity.","Wang, D; Guo, TT; Guo, Q; Zhang, S; Zhang, JH; Luo, J",2019,0,"FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY","FRONT PSYCHOL","V10","","Article","schizophrenia; creativity; genes; divergent thinking; risk variants","NEUREGULIN 1 GENE; SINGLE-NUCLEOTIDE POLYMORPHISMS; FAMILY-BASED ASSOCIATION; GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; BIPOLAR DISORDER; COMMON VARIANTS; DIVERGENT THINKING; SUSCEPTIBILITY GENE; LINKAGE; EXPRESSION","1664-1078","10.3389/fpsyg.2019.02218","WOS:000496963000001"
"58","Fostering creativity and communicative soft skills through leisure activities in management studies","Purpose The purpose of this paper is to gain insight into the way leisure activities and soft skills relate to creativity in higher education. It determines which activities have a positive impact on the student body's overall education. Previous research evidences the relationship between specific leisure activities and creativity performance in several scenarios. Our work applies a broad range of these leisure activities to find results within our own specific student population. Design/methodology/approach The methodology is based on a survey of 303 Spanish students in Business Administration and Tourism. The study uses two instruments to measure the creativity of students, the Runco Ideational Behavior Scale (RIBS) and a three-dimensional construct that measures divergent thinking (originality, fluency and flexibility). Findings The results reveal that the average for creativity is higher for those students participating in some of the activities proposed. A positive correlation was also observed between the number of leisure activities and the creativity measures analysed. This confirms that students participating in more leisure activities display higher levels of creativity. Finally, the results display that the vast majority of students are involved in some type of activity, but two of the interpersonal skills that companies appreciate the most (reading and writing) are performed by very few students. This is especially the case of writing. Originality/value This study contributes to the pedagogical strategies that can be used in universities to motivate practising leisure activities as a mean of fostering creativity. It is important to note that the involvement of students in leisure activities can benefit from their integration into the labour market.","Mareque, M; Creo, ED; Gonzalez-Sanchez, MB",2019,0,"EDUCATION AND TRAINING","EDUC TRAIN","V61","1","Article","Creativity; Soft skills; Divergent thinking; Leisure activities; University studies","STUDENTS; PERCEPTIONS; IMPACT","0040-0912","10.1108/ET-07-2018-0149","WOS:000461587700007"

"60","Stimulating Creativity: Modulation of Convergent and Divergent Thinking by Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS)","divergent thinking, the search for multiple solutions to a single problem, and convergent thinking, the quest for a single solution either through an analytical process or the experience of insight. Studies have demonstrated that these abilities can be improved by cognitive stimulation, mood, and meditation. This investigation examined whether convergent and divergent thinking can be enhanced by noninvasive transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). In different sessions, participants received bilateral stimulation over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortexDLPFC (Experiment1) and over the posterior parietal cortex-PPC (Experiment2), while performing the Compound Remote Associative task (CRA) assessing convergent thinking and the Alternative Uses Task (AUT) assessing divergent thinking. In Experiment1, anodal-left cathodal-right stimulation over the DLPFC significantly enhanced CRA performance. In Experiment2, stimulations over the PPC significantly increased insight solutions and decreased analytical solutions compared to the no stimulation condition. These findings provide direct evidence for the role of the left DLPFC in convergent and divergent thinking and a mediating role of the PPC in problem-solving behavior, presumably through attentional processes. From a methodological perspective, brain stimulation can be used as a tool to modulate and to explore components of creativity.","Zmigrod, S; Colzato, LS; Hommel, B",2015,11,"CREATIVITY RESEARCH JOURNAL","CREATIVITY RES J","V27","4","Article","","DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE; RESPONSE INTEGRATION; PARIETAL CORTEX; INSIGHT; BRAIN; ATTENTION; HUMANS; TASK; TOOL","1040-0419","10.1080/10400419.2015.1087280","WOS:000364557100008"
"61","Recovering inspiration in the spaces of creative writing","This paper emerges from a project conducted between academics in literary studies and geography that explored the creative process amongst writers who write for pleasure. It seeks to understand writing as creative process as well as simply representation, recovering process as a part of creative making. Building on a long tradition of theorising process and creativity in literary studies, which has cumulatively discredited the idea of inspiration, this paper asks whether a fresh engagement between geography, literary studies and other work on creative writing can provide new insights into the creative process. Recognising that questions of representation have been pursued with different trajectories in geography and literary studies, this paper attempts to identify our common intellectual concerns as well as asking whether a rapprochement between questions of representation and non-representational theory can provide the stimulus for an enlivened account that recovers the place of inspiration in creative writing.","Brace, C; Johns-Putra, A",2010,18,"TRANSACTIONS OF THE INSTITUTE OF BRITISH GEOGRAPHERS","T I BRIT GEOGR","V35","3","Article","creative writing; inspiration; geography; literary studies representation; non-representational theory","WEST COAST PATH; CULTURAL-GEOGRAPHY; LANDSCAPE","0020-2754","10.1111/j.1475-5661.2010.00390.x","WOS:000278316300007"
"62","How Pixar Fosters collective creativity","Many people believe that good ideas are rarer and more valuable than good people. Ed Catmull, president of Pixar and Disney Animation Studios, couldn't disagree more. That notion, he says, is rooted in a misguided view of creativity that exaggerates the importance of the initial idea in developing an original product. And it reflects a profound misunderstanding of how to manage the large risks inherent in producing breakthroughs. In filmmaking and many other kinds of complex product development, creativity involves a large number of people from different disciplines working effectively together to solve a great many inherently unforeseeable problems. The trick to fostering collective creativity, Catmull says, is threefold: Place the creative authority for product development firmly in the hands of the project leaders (as opposed to corporate executives)","Catmull, E",2008,51,"HARVARD BUSINESS REVIEW","HARVARD BUS REV","V86","9","Article","","","0017-8012","","WOS:000258627300015"
"63","The Development and Validity of a Chinese Version of the Compound Remote Associates Test","Numerous recent studies have used neuroscientific methods such as event-related potentials and functional magnetic resonance imaging to demystify insight and creativity. To do so, 1 key prerequisite is the creation of a large enough number of homogeneous problems that can reliably produce insight-like experiences within a short time window. The Remote Associates Test (RAT) and its variant, the compound remote associate (CRA) problems developed by Bowden and Jung-Beeman (2003), are 2 of the most popular and important instruments for unraveling the behavioral and cognitive, especially electrophysiological and neural, mechanisms of creative thinking and insight. However, little research has examined cognitive, neural, or even behavioral correlates of remote association and creative insight in the Chinese context because of the absence of a Chinese RAT/CRA. The present work, based on Mednick's (1962) associative theory, developed a Chinese version of the CRA test with enough items. The reliability, criterion-related validity, and underlying structure of this test were then further assessed. The results revealed that the test possesses satisfactory psychometric properties and is an appropriate psychometric instrument for uncovering neural correlates of creative thinking, creative insight, and associative thought.","Shen, WB; Yuan, Y; Liu, C; Yi, BS; Dou, K",2016,5,"AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY","AM J PSYCHOL","V129","3","Article","Remote Associates Test (RAT); creativity; insight problem solving; convergent thinking","WORKING-MEMORY; CREATIVITY; INSIGHT; INTELLIGENCE; CURIOSITY; PERFORMANCE; CONVERGENT; DIVERGENT; TASK; SELF","0002-9556","","WOS:000381451000003"
"64","Relationships between intelligence and creativity in gifted and non-gifted children","The interplay between creativity and intelligence has been extensively documented for decades. However, there is currently no consensus on how these constructs are related. The threshold hypothesis states that intelligence fosters creativity only below a 120 cut-off IQ. To clarify these issues, the relationships between intelligence and creativity were studied, using respectively WISC-IV and EPoC (Evaluation of Potential Creativity), in 338 children including 118 intellectually gifted children (IQ >= 130) and 220 non-gifted children (IQ < 130). Weak correlations were found between intelligence and creativity. However, high verbal ability children (Verbal Comprehension Index 130) showed significantly higher scores on verbal tasks of EPoC. Additionally, the threshold effect was only found for correlations between verbal integrative thinking and perceptual reasoning or processing speed. Thus, the findings indicate that the threshold effect depends on the type of process involved in the expression of creativity (divergent or integrative thinking), the domain of creativity (verbal or graphic), and the factors of intelligence considered. Taken together, these results suggest that giftedness should be conceptualized by specifying the cognitive domain of high ability, rather than focusing on a general conception of intelligence, and by distinguishing intellectual and creative giftedness.

"65","Performativity and the event: enacting a philosophy of difference","What is performativity? In this paper I set out to encounter this question by intimating the directions we are forced to consider when thinking through the performative. In centring my arguments within the corpus of Deleuze's philosophy of difference I advocate academic production as creative of thought. This is to suggest a performative thinking and doing that unfolds our way of looking at our social, corporeal, human dramas and the technologies by which we feel able to analyse something, and in so doing, enact its constitution. Coursing underneath this issue of performativity is the problematisation of the term of the subject-what if the event was more important? What do we understand of the event if not through a sense of subjectivity? Insinuated within the confrontation with performativity are fundamental implications associated with the timing of something as it happens, the centrality of the material and visceral body to this, and the settings through which events take place. Arguing through this triality I extract three symptomatic themes of performativity: that it speaks of irretrievability, indeterminacy, and excess. Ethically, and in conclusion, emphasis is placed on the empiricism of life in its doing-the present moment of immediate uncertain happening as we are continually enacted out of 'knowing' how to go on within concrete, material circumstances.","Dewsbury, JD",2000,184,"ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING D-SOCIETY & SPACE","ENVIRON PLANN D","V18","4","Review","","DELEUZE,GILLES; EMPIRICISM","0263-7758","10.1068/d200t","WOS:000088676000004"

We accomplish two main tasks. First, we show that in the so called balanced growth path (BGP) equilibrium, growth is unbalanced because R&D takes place only on the machine line With the highest quality. Second, we show how a policymaker can alter the basic model so that the resulting equilibrium has balanced growth in the sense that there is R&D across all the different machine lines.

To more richly examine artists' thinking, concurrent verbal protocols from 23 artists and 23 nonartists creating original drawings were analyzed. Parsed clauses were reliably coded into categories representing cognitive processes (descriptions, plans, goals), metacognitive processes (comparing different points in time, considering hypothetical plans, monitoring progress, etc.), and evaluations (positive, negative, uncertain, neutral). Artists and nonartists were compared on the proportion of statements in each category, both prior to and while drawing. Overall, both groups' protocols were dominated by descriptions, followed by plans, and more distantly by goals and metagoals. Evaluations were also common, comprising about 25% of statements in each group. During drawing, artists made more goal, more positive evaluations, and fewer negative evaluations than did nonartists. Artists also engaged in more metacognition having to do with monitoring the emerging progress of the drawing. Results are largely consistent with earlier findings in the expertise literature, suggesting it is a profitable framework for understanding artistic creativity.","Fayena-Tawil, F; Kozbelt, A; Sitaras, L",2011,13,"PSYCHOLOGY OF AESTHETICS CREATIVITY AND THE ARTS","PSYCHOL AESTHET CREA","V5","2","Article","artists; problem solving; cognition; metacognition; evaluation","PROBLEM CONSTRUCTION; CREATIVE PROCESS; SKILLS; PERFORMANCE; ART","1931-3896","10.1037/a0021019","WOS:000291124600004"
"70","Dreaming to reduce fantasy? - Fantasy proneness, dissociation, and subjective sleep experiences","Fantasy proneness refers to an extensive involvement in fantasy and daydreaming. Previous studies have shown that fantasy proneness overlaps with dissociative tendencies, as measured with the Dissociative Experiences Scale. We tested the hypothesis that deviant sleep experiences form the critical link between fantasy proneness and dissociation. Undergraduate students (N = 205) completed the Creative Experiences Questionnaire, the Dissociative Experiences Scale, and the Iowa Sleep Experiences Survey. Self-reports of sleep experiences, such as narcolepsy, vivid and unusual dreams, and deviant nocturnal experiences, but not lucid dreaming, were related to both fantasy proneness and dissociation. However, the relationship between fantasy proneness and dissociation was only partially accounted for by these sleep experiences. This suggests that deviant sleep experiences but also other, as yet unknown, factors contribute to the overlap between fantasy proneness and dissociation. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Entrepreneurial resources are defined as the propensity of an individual to behave creatively, act with foresight, use intuition, and be alert to new opportunities. This paper assumes that these entrepreneurial resources can be distributed in two ways throughout the firm: they can be held by one or a few individuals-""individual entrepreneurial resources""-or they can be dispersed among a team of individuals-""team entrepreneurial resources."" Agency theory is used to consider how various organizational characteristics-such as the assignment of decision responsibilities, incentives and risk bearing, the number of hierarchical levels, horizontal linking structures, mutual monitoring and bonding devices, and information systems-will differ in the individual and team entrepreneurial forms. Generally, the individual entrepreneurial form resembles the ""classic entrepreneurial firm"" (Fama and Jensen 1983) in which various decision making roles and risk bearing are performed by a single entrepreneur. The team entrepreneurial form is similar to what Bartlett and Ghoshal (1993) call ""beyond the m-form.""

Findings The current study shows cognitive diversity has a significant association with knowledge sharing, and knowledge sharing positively associated with team innovation. The findings of this study indicate that team climate moderates the relationship between cognitive diversity and knowledge sharing. Additionally, knowledge sharing is found not to be a significant mediation on the relationship between cognitive diversity and team innovation.

The participants were 52 architecture students. The experimental task was to design a small museum in a described context. After completing the task, the students self-assessed their creativity in designing with seven open-ended questions, the Self-Assessment of Creative Design questionnaire, and a list of seven items tapping affective metacognitive aspects of the designing process. Thus, 21 creativity indicators were formed. Four expert architects, working independently, assessed the designs on nine creativity indicators: fluency, flexibility, elaboration, functionality, innovation, fulfilling specified design requirements, considering context, mastery of skills concerning the esthetics of the design representation, and overall creativity. The agreement among the architects' evaluations was very high. The correlations between the nine corresponding indicators in students' assessment of their design and those of the experts were positive and significant with respect to three indicators: fluency, flexibility, and overall creativity. On the contrary, the correlations of the rest noncorresponding indicators with those of the experts were not significant.

Two examples of this evolution are in her use of colours and personal pronouns. Namely, we note a consistently increasing preference towards black and white above other colour words from 1956 to 1963 and, in contrast, we observe a marked transition from dominant use of third-person feminine to dominant use of first-person singular in her later work. We find that the most dynamic changes in word use occurred between March and May 1959 and we tie these observations to events recorded in Plath's journal entries.

"81","Toward a Cultural Economic Geography of Creative Industries and Urban Development: Introduction to the Special Issue on Creative Industries and Urban Development","The connections between the development of creative industries and the growth of cities was noted by several sources in the first decade of the twenty-first century, but explanations relating to the nature of the link have thus far proven to be insufficient. The two dominant ""scripts"" were those of ""creative clusters"" and ""creative/cities/creative class"" theories, but both have significant limitations arising from how they privilege amenities-led, supply-driven accounts of urban development and how they fail to adequately situate cities in wider global circuits of culture and economic production. The author proposes that the emergent field of cultural economic geography provides some insights that redress these lacunae, particularly in the possibilities for an original synthesis of cultural and economic geography, cultural studies, and new strands of economic theory.","Flew, T",2010,23,"INFORMATION SOCIETY","INFORM SOC","V26","2","Article","cities; clusters; creative class; creative industries; cultural economic geography; cultural studies; urban development","CLUSTERS; SPACES; CITIES","0197-2243","10.1080/01972240903562704","WOS:000274906500001"
"82","Betwixt and between: Role conflict, role ambiguity and role definition in project-based dual-leadership structures","Project-based organizations in the film industry usually have a dual-leadership structure, based on a division of tasks between the dual leaders - the director and the producer - in which the former is predominantly responsible for the artistic and the latter for the commercial aspects of the film. These organizations also have a role hierarchically below and between the dual leaders: the 1st assistant director. This organizational constellation is likely to lead to role conflict and role ambiguity experienced by the person occupying that particular role. Although prior studies found negative effects of role conflict and role ambiguity, this study shows they can also have beneficial effects because they create space for defining the role expansively that, in turn, can be facilitated by the dual leaders defining their own roles more narrowly. In a more general sense, this study also shows the usefulness of analyzing the antecedents and consequences of roles, role definition, and role crafting in connection to the behavior of occupants of adjacent roles.","Ebbers, JJ; Wijnberg, NM",2017,0,"HUMAN RELATIONS","HUM RELAT","V70","11","Article","creative industries; dual leadership; film industry; project-based organization; role crafting","MATRIX ORGANIZATION; FILM INDUSTRY; WORK; PERFORMANCE; JOB; MANAGEMENT; MODEL; ORIENTATIONS; METAANALYSIS; CITIZENSHIP","0018-7267","10.1177/0018726717692852","WOS:000412537800003"
"83","Move contribution and creativity among children aged between four and six","The aim of this research is to see how move contribution at kindergarten may have an impact on children's creativity. Eighty-six children took part in the study, being divided into three groups according to their weekly move activity. The pupils had accelerometers (GT1M) and took Krampen's creativity test (1996). The results show that the children, attending classes with move, get superior values in moderate to vigourous physical activity (MVPA) and especially superior ones in counts per minute (CountsPmin) in their school life (P<0.01). The results are more qualified in extra-curricular activities. Moreover, the results show differences in terms of creativity between pupils, depending on the classes they attend. More specifically, depending on the sub-tests and the period considered, the scores obtained by the classes with move, are superior of those of normal classes. To understand the stakes of the introduction of such programmes, as well as their effects in the long term, are prospects to consider for future research in this field. (C) 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS.

"85","The Multivariate Approach and Design of the Creative Process","Creativity is often described as an essential aspect of the innovative design process. As such, many authors have proposed models aiming to describe existing creative practices, both at the macro level-i.e. the stages involved in a creative process-and at the micro level-i.e. the underlying cognitive processes. Conversely, many other models are of a prescriptive nature: their goal is not to describe existing practices, but to structure them in order to help professionals deal with the uncertainty that is inherent to creativity. Whatever the type, such models aim to answer the following question: how can creative work be structured in order to ensure the optimal deployment of creative potential? The multivariate approach posits that creative behaviour is made possible by interactions between multiple resources including cognitive, conative, emotional and environmental factors. Like existing models, the multivariate approach has shown potential for both descriptive and prescriptive modelling of the creative process. In this chapter, we will review existing research on the multivariate approach of creativity. We will begin by describing the theoretical and methodological background of such models. We will then go on to describe some of the results obtained by multivariate modelling of the creative process in recent years. Finally, we describe some prospects for future research, specifically concerning prescriptive modelling-that is, the design of the creative process.","Nelson, J; Botella, M",2017,0,"CREATIVITY, DESIGN THINKING AND INTERDISCIPLINARITY","CREATIVITY TWENTY FI","","","Article; Book Chapter","Creative process; Multivariate approach; Prescriptive modelling","ENGINEERING DESIGN; WORK-ENVIRONMENT; DOMAIN; PSYCHOLOGY; INNOVATION; THINKING; MODELS","2364-6675","10.1007/978-981-10-7524-7_7","WOS:000438413000008"
"86","How does the collaboration with dominant R&D performers impact new R&D employees' innovation performance in different cultural contexts? A comparative study of American and Chinese large firms","In R&D activity that is more dependent upon innovative ideas, does culture still play a significant role in determining the impact of leader-member relationship on R&D employees' innovation performance? Prior studies mostly examined the cultural influence in a general sense, but studies making a cross-cultural comparison especially in divergent work settings are rare. This study thus contributes to existing literatures by empirically testing the culturally implicit leadership theory in R&D activity with the patent co-inventing data of 51 Chinese and American firms. We find that compared with those in American firms, new R&D employees who act as subordinates in Chinese firms have stronger initiatives to collaborate with dominant R&D performers who act as leaders, while new R&D employees in American firms appear to be more indifferent to this relationship, even if they are aware that an earlier collaboration with dominant R&D performers is beneficial. In Chinese cultural context that is characterized by hierarchy and collectivism, this collaboration plays an inverted parabolic role in determining the new R&D employees' innovation performance from both quantitative and qualitative aspects. By comparison, this impact is not significant in American culture that is distinguished by democracy and individualism. Policy implications based on the Chinese cultural context are given at the end of this study.","Zhang, GP; Wang, X; Duan, HB",2019,0,"TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE","TECHNOL FORECAST SOC","V148","","Article","New R&D employee; Dominant R&D performer; Individualistic culture; Collectivistic culture; Leader-member relationship","LEADER-MEMBER EXCHANGE; PATERNALISTIC LEADERSHIP; TRANSFORMATIONAL LEADERSHIP; NATIONAL CULTURE; JOB-PERFORMANCE; SOCIAL NETWORKS; MEDIATING ROLE; WORK BEHAVIOR; LINKING LMX; CREATIVITY","0040-1625","10.1016/j.techfore.2019.119728","WOS:000502883400012"

"89","Participants' perspectives on the social bonding and well-being effects of creative arts adult education classes","Background: Evidence suggests that adult education classes have a positive impact on well-being, but whether this is true for all course activities is unknown. Methods: A UK adult education charity ran four singing classes, two craft classes and a creative writing class for the purpose of this study. Written responses to open questions about health, well-being and social lives were collected from participants at the end of the 7-month courses. Results: The classes enhanced well-being by improving mood and providing a sense of belonging. The classes helped participants develop self-confidence, create and strengthen relationships, and encouraged more active lives. Participants valued meeting people from their community and used these ties to access information about local opportunities. However, some participants reported negative experiences linked to unfavourable self-other comparison. Conclusions: These results highlight how regular adult education classes involving creativity can enhance well-being and help community integration regardless of the subject studied.","Pearce, E",2017,3,"ARTS & HEALTH","ARTS HEALTH","V9","1","Article","Self-efficacy; social capital; mental health","SHORT-FORM; HEALTH; FAMILIARITY; BENEFITS; VALIDITY; FINLAND; SCALE; LIFE","1753-3015","10.1080/17533015.2016.1193550","WOS:000396629500004"

The measurements used were a questionnaire about imaginary companions, 3 estimates of creative potential, and a self-image inventory. Among the 69 participating 4th graders, 52% reported having (had) imaginary companions. The children with imaginary companions were more creative on 2 of 3 estimates of creativity and had lower self-image scores. The self-image differences were greatest on the subscales measuring psychological well-being and peer relations. It was more common for girls to have imaginary companions. Aspects associated with creativity among the children with imaginary companions were, for example, elaboration of the companion's character and number of imaginary companions.","Hoff, EV",2005,33,"CREATIVITY RESEARCH JOURNAL","CREATIVITY RES J","V17","2-3","Article","","YOUNG-CHILDREN; PRESCHOOL-CHILDREN; WAITING ABILITY","1040-0419","10.1207/s15326934crj1702&3_4","WOS:000230130200004"
"91","Incentivizing the Creative Process: From Initial Quantity to Eventual Creativity","In two experiments, we examine whether performance-contingent incentives facilitate the creative process by enhancing the initial preparation that precedes creative incubation. The defining characteristic of both experiments is a second-stage task that is separated in time from the first-stage implementation of different incentive schemes. In Experiment 1, the second stage takes place ten days after we implement conditions with quantity incentives, high-creativity incentives, incentives with a minimum-creativity threshold, and a fixed-pay control condition. In Experiment 2, we test the effects of incentives with an incubation period of 20 minutes, during which an experimenter escorts participants on a walk between compensated work periods. In both experiments, we find that participants with quantity incentives outperform the high-creativity production of their fixed-pay counterparts only in the second-stage task. Mediation analyses suggest that quantity-incentivized participants' propensity to try more divergent ideas in the first stage sparks their creativity advantage in the second stage.","Kachelmeier, SJ; Wang, LW; Williamson, MG",2019,0,"ACCOUNTING REVIEW","ACCOUNT REV","V94","2","Article","creative process; incentives; incubation; long-term production","STATISTICAL MEDIATION ANALYSIS; MANAGEMENT CONTROL; PERFORMANCE; COMPENSATION; SELECTION; REWARDS; DESIGN; BARON","0001-4826","10.2308/accr-52196","WOS:000464110800011"
"92","Indigenous Hip-hop: overcoming marginality, encountering constraints","This paper discusses the creative and contemporary performances of young Indigenous hip-hoppers in two seemingly disparate places (Nowra, NSW, and Torres Strait Islands, QLD). Visiting two Indigenous hip-hop groups from these placesand drawing on interviews and participant observationwe explore the way in which emerging technologies, festivals, programs and online networking have helped enable unique forms of music making. In contrast to racist discourses depicting Indigenous youth as idle or inactive, our research participants demonstrated musical aspiration, creativity and a desire to express love of country and culture. Rather than assume cities and urban centres are hubs for creativity, hip-hop production is geographically mobile, operating in locations removed from large population centres. Indigenous hip-hop links up-and-coming with more experienced performers in what amounts to a semi-formal, political, transnational and anti-colonial creative industry. Geographical distance remains an ongoing challenge, but more than this, wider patron discourses framing what is expected from 'proper' Indigenous performance are the more profound coalface of marginalisation.","Warren, A; Evitt, R",2010,19,"AUSTRALIAN GEOGRAPHER","AUST GEOGR","V41","1","Article","Indigenous; young people; hip-hop; creativity; performance; patron discourses; marginalisation; Nowra; Torres Strait Islands","IDENTITY","0004-9182","10.1080/00049180903535659","WOS:000277461000011"

"94","Research towards a systematic signature discovery process","In its most general form, a signature is a unique or distinguishing measurement, pattern, or collection of data that identifies a phenomenon (object, action, or behavior) of interest. The discovery of signatures is an important aspect of a wide range of disciplines from basic science to national security for the rapid and efficient detection and/or prediction of phenomena. Current practice in signature discovery is typically accomplished by asking domain experts to characterize and/or model individual phenomena to identify what might compose a useful signature. What is lacking is an approach that can be applied across a broad spectrum of domains and information sources to efficiently and robustly construct candidate signatures, validate their reliability, measure their quality, and overcome the challenge of detection - all in the face of dynamic conditions, measurement obfuscation, and noisy data environments. Our research has focused on the identification of common elements of signature discovery across application domains and the synthesis of those elements into a systematic process for more robust and efficient signature development. In this way, a systematic signature discovery process lays the groundwork for leveraging knowledge obtained from signatures to a particular domain or problem area, and, more generally, to problems outside that domain. This paper presents the initial results of this research by discussing a mathematical framework for representing signatures and placing that framework in the context of a systematic signature discovery process. Additionally, the basic steps of this process are described with details about the methods available to support the different stages of signature discovery, development, and deployment.","Baker, NA; Barr, JL; Bonheyo, GT; Joslyn, CA; Krishnaswami, K; Oxley, ME; Quadrel, R; Sego, LH; Tardiff, MF; Wynne, AS",2013,3,"2013 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY INFORMATICS: BIG DATA, EMERGENT THREATS, AND DECISION-MAKING IN SECURITY INFORMATICS","","","","Proceedings Paper","","IDEA; PRODUCTIVITY; PERFORMANCE; CREATIVITY; GENERATION; ALIGNMENT; QUALITY; CANCER","","","WOS:000327025200075"

Drawing on the appraisal model of emotion, this study tested whether and how emotions with varying levels of uncertainty appraisals affect biases against creativity. This experimental study showed that fear, characterized by a high-uncertainty appraisal, promoted implicit, but not explicit, biases against creativity more strongly than low-uncertainty emotions such as anger and happiness. Compared with individuals who experienced anger and happiness, those who experienced fear provided lower creativity ratings because of their implicit biases against creativity. These results highlight the importance of considering emotions to understand the individuals' biases against creativity and their recognition of creative ideas.","Lee, YS; Chang, JY; Choi, JN",2017,0,"CREATIVITY RESEARCH JOURNAL","CREATIVITY RES J","V29","3","Article","","ASSOCIATION TEST; SELF-ESTEEM; MOOD; INNOVATION; METAANALYSIS; ACTIVATION; COGNITION; EMOTIONS; MODEL; ANGER","1040-0419","10.1080/10400419.2017.1360061","WOS:000411094800001"

In the first two studies, we manipulated intersexual and intrasexual selection by having male participants take part in a simulated dating game (Study 1) or imagine having a date (Study 2). In both studies, participants were told either that the target female would choose her date (intersexual) or that male suitors would nominate one another (intrasexual). Under the intersexual selection condition, men demonstrated increased creativity levels and decreased aggression levels, whereas the opposite pattern was observed under the intrasexual selection condition. Study 3 showed that individual differences in creativity and aggression as personality traits similarly predicted intrasexual and intersexual mating strategies, respectively. These extend existing evolutionary mating research by specifying the mechanism of intrasexual or intersexual selection in shaping men's weapon-like or ornament-like situational response and personality development.","Chen, BB; Chang, L",2015,5,"EVOLUTIONARY PSYCHOLOGY","EVOL PSYCHOL-US","V13","1","Article","sexual selection; ornament; weapon; creativity; aggression; mating","PHYSICAL RISK-TAKING; SEXUAL SELECTION; MATE PREFERENCES; CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION; ROMANTIC MOTIVES; SOCIAL-CONFLICT; SELF-ESTEEM; HUMANS; CATEGORIZATION; FACE","1474-7049","10.1177/147470491501300118","WOS:000352203500018"

Specifically, we looked at how two critical factors (physicians' creative traits and authoritarian personality) are related to innovation readiness within the medical care system in Taiwan. We argue that innovation readiness is the cognitive precursor to the behaviors supporting innovation. Additionally, we also examine the moderating effects of hospital types (teaching versus non-teaching hospitals) on these relationships. Data from 417 physicians belonging to 26 hospitals is used to test our hypotheses. Results show that the degree of innovation readiness a physician perceives is associated with both creative traits and authoritarian personality. With regard to the organizational variable, the evidence shows that of the specific kind of hospital is far less important than the people who work there when it comes to innovation readiness.","Chen, IH; Lee, AYP; Parboteeah, KP; Lai, CS; Chung, A",2014,3,"INNOVATION-MANAGEMENT POLICY & PRACTICE","INNOV-MANAG POLICY P","V16","1","Article","authoritarian personality; creative traits; innovation readiness","ADJECTIVE CHECK LIST; ORGANIZATIONAL READINESS; CREATIVE PERSONALITY; PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT; CONTEXTUAL FACTORS; ADOPTION; HEALTH; TECHNOLOGY; DIFFUSION; SYSTEMS","2204-0226","10.5172/impp.2014.16.1.158","WOS:000347241900012"
